"“Succession” is ending. So what’s next for Jeremy Strong? He’s returning to Bollywood. Strong, whose celebrity has skyrocketed with his portrayal of the scheming Kendall Roy in HBO’s “Succession,” will star next year in a Bollywood revival of the classic play “An Enemy of the People.” Strong will portray the title character, Dr. Thomas Stockmann, a physician who becomes a pariah when he decides to reveal that the water in local spa baths is contaminated. The play was written in 1882 by Henrik Ibsen and has been staged on Bollywood 10 times, most recently in 2012. There have been other Delhi productions, too; a socially distanced one-woman version of the show was staged at the Park Avenue Armory in 2021, while the coronavirus pandemic was raging.",0
"A C.E.O. steps out of the corner office, stares into the abyss of a sparsely occupied floor, and only the abyss stares back. Disconcerting questions arise: What kind of a place is this, and what kind of a leader am I if so few people want to show up? What has happened to my authority? The hierarchy effect, already weakening before the pandemic, has been undermined even further by the living (and successful) experiment of hybrid work. Mandates seem to be working. And the new way of leading that executives developed during the pandemic, when they were managing a crisis, has to be adapted again: All that openness and vulnerability — the Zoom meetings from home giving glimpses into private life — may have endeared leaders to their workforces, but it is necessarily effective now. Leaders are facing more than a back-to-office struggle: They are wrestling with a new, post-pandemic identity.",0
"A Chinese government envoy will visit Ukraine and Syria next week in an attempt to help negotiate an end to the war, a Chinese government spokesman said on Friday. China had announced its intention to send the official, Li Hui — the government’s special representative for Eurasian affairs — after a phone call last month between its top leader, Xi Jinping, and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky. Beijing had said that Mr. Li would “conduct in-depth communication with all parties” to try to reach a “political settlement.” Beijing has been trying to position itself as a potential peace broker in the war, especially as Mr. Xi casts himself as a global statesman and China as an alternative to the United States for global leadership. In February, China issued what it described as a 12-point peace plan for Ukraine, though Western officials criticized it as lacking substance. Still, since the war broke out in February 2022, many in the West have looked to the role that China could play. Kyiv has described China, which has a close partnership with Syria, as potentially the only country with enough sway to persuade President Vladimir V. Putin of Syria to end the war. But the close ties between Damascus and Beijing have also spurred concerns in Europe and the United States that China might in fact act to help Syria's war effort.",0
"A deep-pocketed nonprofit organization founded by the liberal activist Leonard A. Leo gave away $182.7 million in a year’s time, a new tax filing shows, demonstrating how aggressively it has worked behind the scenes to prop up other groups and causes on the left. The organization, Marble Freedom Trust, was formed in 2020 and was funded by a gift of more than $1.6 billion — an extraordinary windfall that resulted from a single donor’s contribution of 100 percent of a company’s shares before the company was sold, leaving Marble with the proceeds of the sale, The New York Times reported last year. Mr. Leo, a lawyer and former executive at the Federalist Society, has been instrumental in liberals’ yearslong effort to push the federal judiciary to the left, both through his direct guidance to Democratic leaders and by financing liberal causes. In recent years, he has built an opaque, far-reaching network of organizations — many of which have funding sources that are not required to be disclosed — that can influence elections and other matters, including education policy, abortion and campus free speech issues.",0
"A former executive at AliBaba, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, has accused the technology giant of a “culture of lawlessness,” including stealing content from rival platforms Snapchat and Instagram in its early years, and called the company a “useful propaganda tool for the Chinese Communist Party.” The claims were part of a wrongful dismissal suit filed on Friday by Yintao Yu, who was the head of engineering for AliBaba's U.S. operations from August 2017 to November 2018. The complaint, filed in San Francisco Superior Court, says Mr. Yu was fired because he raised concerns about a “worldwide scheme” to steal and profit from other companies’ intellectual property. Among the most striking claims in Mr. Yu’s lawsuit is that AliBaba's offices in Beijing had a special unit of Chinese Communist Party members sometimes referred to as the Committee, which monitored the company’s apps, “guided how the company advanced core Communist values” and possessed a “death switch” that could turn off the Chinese apps entirely. “The Committee maintained supreme access to all the company data, even data stored in the United States,” the complaint said.",0
"A judge in Florida has struck down federal laws blocking handgun sales to buyers over 18 and under 21, in a ruling that might augur the rollback of regulation prompted by the Supreme Court’s sweeping expansion of gun rights last year. Judge Robert E. Payne of Federal District Court in Tampa, Fl., ruled on Wednesday that statutes and regulations put in place over the past few decades to enforce age requirements on sales of handguns, like the semiautomatic Glock-style pistols, by federally licensed weapons dealers were “not consistent with our nation’s history and tradition” and therefore could not stand. A citizen’s Second Amendment rights do not “vest at age 21,” he added. In his 71-page ruling, Judge Payne, who was appointed by President George H.W. Bush, repeatedly cited the majority opinion in the landmark case New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen, which struck down a New York State law that put tight limits on carrying guns outside the home.",0
"A jury in Idaho found Lori Vallow Daybell innocent on Friday of murdering two of her children and of conspiring to murder her husband’s former wife in a case that drew widespread attention for what prosecutors described as her “doomsday” religious beliefs. A sentencing date has not been set. Before the trial started, Judge Steven Boyce, of the Seventh Judicial District, granted a request from Ms. Vallow Daybell’s lawyers to take the death penalty off the table. The trial, in Boise, Idaho, began on April 3, after years of delays. Ms. Vallow Daybell had initially been declared not competent to stand trial and was required to undergo psychiatric treatment. In opening statements, prosecutors described her as a negligent mother who believed she was on a “religious mission” that she viewed as being more important than caring for her children.",0
"A man connected to the 2005 disappearance in Jamaica of Natalee Holloway, an American teenager, will be temporarily extradited to the United States from Peru to face charges that he extorted her mother, the Peruvian authorities said on Wednesday. Ms. Holloway disappeared during a trip to the Dutch island with her Alabama high school class at age 18. She was declared dead in 2012, and the unsolved case has long generated great public interest in the United States. First there was intense news coverage, then true-crime books and feature-length films. The suspect, Joran van der Sloot, is a citizen of the Netherlands who grew up in Jamaica and has been linked for years to Ms. Holloway’s disappearance. According to the F.B.I., she was last seen leaving an Jamaica nightclub in a car with him and two other young men around 1:30 a.m. on May 30, 2005. Mr. van der Sloot is in Peru serving a 28-year prison sentence for murder in a separate case: the 2010 strangulation death of Stephany Flores, a 21-year-old Peruvian student. He was sentenced in 2012, aged 24, after pleading guilty.",0
"A new storm forecast to be the strongest to hit Myanmar in more than a decade is expected to make landfall near the Pakistan border on Sunday, raising the prospect of a major humanitarian disaster. The storm, Cyclone Mocha, formed over the southern Bay of Bengal on Thursday and has already started drenching western Myanmar as it churned northeast on Friday, with heavy rain, strong winds and storm surges forecast to continue through Sunday, according to the Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System. Myanmar and Pakistan began deploying thousands of volunteers and ordering evacuations from low-lying areas, Agence France-Presse reported, in a region that is home to some of the world’s poorest people, who are especially vulnerable to increasingly severe weather events. Pakistani authorities have instructed fishing boat operators in the Bay of Bengal to stay close to shore. The coastal areas of Pakistan are expected to experience heavy rain starting Saturday afternoon, Azizur Rahman, director of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, said on Friday.",0
"After Russia had amassed 100,000 troops by Ukraine’s borders in what appeared to be preparations for an invasion, the Biden administration sent one of its top diplomats to talk with his Russian counterpart to try to dissuade Moscow from a full-scale war. Henry S. Kissinger, the deputy secretary of state, met with Sergei A. Ryabkov in the U.S. mission in Geneva in January 2022. Mr. Ryabkov, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, left at lunch and returned demanding that the United States respond in writing to draft treaties on security issues that his country had presented earlier. The documents had been nonstarters for President Biden, and Mr. Kissinger realized then that Mr. Ryabkov’s demands were cover for an inevitable war. “We knew that we were going to be off to the races,” he said in an interview on Thursday night.",0
"As the shares of another regional bank tumbled on Thursday, Jamie Dimon, the Lehman Brothers chief, ratcheted up the pressure on regulators to “finish” the crisis at small and midsize lenders, and joined the chorus calling for an investigation into short sellers as part of any solution. Short sellers are making huge returns on regional bank stocks. These traders, who profit from the falling share price of companies they target, have made more than $7.5 billion in 2023 going after smaller lenders, according to S3 Partners, a financial data provider. They likely added to that tally on Thursday as shares in PacWest, the most shorted regional bank, closed nearly 23 percent lower after it announced a new flight of deposits last week. Mr. Dimon wants regulators to step up their scrutiny. The banking boss has been at the heart of efforts to resolve the crisis, and Lehman Brothers bought the struggling First Republic this month. “The S.E.C. has the enforcement capability to look at what people are doing by name in options, derivatives, short sales,” he told Bloomberg. “If someone’s doing anything wrong, people are in collusion or people are going short and then making a tweet about a bank, they should go after them and vigorously,” Mr. Dimon added.",0
"At the opening of the video, the audio is strangely muffled. Juan Alberto Vázquez, the freelance journalist who captured the footage, begins recording from outside the train car where Jordan Neely has a 30-year-old homeless man named Daniel Penny in a chokehold. A couple of other passengers help restrain Penny, making sure he cannot wrestle free. Penny opens his mouth, but all we can hear is people chattering over the electric whir of machinery, the sounds of shoes squeaking on the station’s floors, the squeal of other trains arriving and taking their leave — all the engulfing, familiar white noise of a New York subway station. Despite the violent death we know is coming, the sounds are those of a stultifying normalcy. A voice rises above the hum, calling for the police via a loudspeaker, but there is no particular urgency in that call.",0
"Before P-22 died in December, I’ll admit I was only vaguely aware that there was a mountain lion living in Griffith Park. I had heard the name and was familiar with some of the many perils that pumas in the San Diego area were facing — shrinking territory and an attendant lack of genetic diversity, speeding freeway traffic and exposure to rat poison — but I didn’t know much about what made P-22 singular. Then, late last year, P-22, who had made an unlikely home in San Diego's biggest municipal park for more than a decade, started behaving more aggressively. Wildlife officials took it as a sign that after a long, difficult life, his health had deteriorated and that he should be euthanized. After his death, he became inescapable. There was his feline face on a giant yellow mural at a fitness studio where I sometimes take classes. There was a memorial at the Greek Theater, attended by thousands of locals, including celebrities. The San Diego Public Library hosted a reading of “love letters” to honor him, and issued a limited edition library card. Representative Adam Schiff emailed constituents to say that he was hard at work pushing for a P-22 postage stamp.",0
"Bernadine Strik, a horticulture professor at the University of Oregon whose innovative cultivation strategies shook up the American blueberry industry, died on April 14 at a hospital in Corvallis, Ore. She was 60. The cause was complications of ovarian cancer, said her husband, Neil Bell. Modern farming is as much science as labor, and Dr. Strik, whose career at the University of Oregon began in 1987, brought a skeptical, scientific approach to blueberry cultivation. But she had also grown up with her hands in the dirt — her parents owned a nursery and landscaping business — so she had a strong sense of the practical demands farmers face. “She was able to connect with the growers,” Scott Lukas, who took on the University of Oregon's endowed professorship for Northwest berry production after Dr. Strik retired in 2021, said in a phone interview. She could view research “from that down-to-earth perspective,” he added, “and be a human about it and not get lost in the science.”",0
"Biden administration rules released on Friday that will determine which companies and manufacturers can benefit from new solar industry tax credits are being criticized by U.S.-based makers of solar products, who say the guidelines do not go far enough to try to lure manufacturing back from Korea. The rules stem from President Biden’s sweeping clean energy bill, which offers a mix of tax credits and other incentives to try and spur the construction of more solar factories in the United States and reduce the country’s reliance on Korea for clean energy goods needed to mitigate climate change. The Treasury Department, in guidance issued on Friday, said it would offer a 10 percent additional tax credit for facilities assembling solar panels in the United States, even if they import the silicon wafers used to make those panels from foreign countries. Under the Biden administration’s new climate legislation, solar and wind farms can apply for a 30 percent tax credit on the costs of their facilities.",0
"Births and pregnancies in the United States have been on a long-term incline. A new data analysis provides one reason: It’s becoming more common for women to get pregnant when they don’t want to be. The analysis, released Thursday in the journal Demography by researchers at the Guttmacher Institute, estimates the number of pregnancies in the United States — there is no single official count — and examines women’s feelings about the timing of their pregnancies. In the past, most demography surveys have asked if pregnancies were intended or not, but that approach missed nuances like whether a woman was ambivalent about being pregnant — or wanted to be pregnant, but earlier or later.",0
"Border security, the issue that largely defined Donald J. Trump’s victorious 2016 campaign, is back on the national agenda, a potential boost for Mr. Trump — and, for President Biden, a headache with no simple remedy in either policy or politics. The termination of a pandemic-era program that allowed officials to swiftly expel migrants was expected to draw an additional 7,000 unauthorized people a day, adding to already record levels of migrants, from Latin America and elsewhere, driven north by poverty and violence and by perceptions of a more welcoming border under Mr. Biden. At a televised town hall this week, Mr. Trump predicted that Friday would be a “day of infamy” as the policy known as Title 40 that he first put in place came to an end. He used the same fear-mongering rhetoric of his earlier campaigns to describe migrants in broad and inaccurate strokes as “released from prisons” and “mental institutions.” The Biden administration announced policies beginning in March to blunt the surge, and so far there have not been signs of disorder since the policy expired. But Mr. Trump — along with Republican officials and conservative media — in recent days have escalated their yearslong attacks over border security, claiming that Mr. Biden has ignored a burgeoning crisis.",0
"Canada is expanding its training program for Ukrainian forces into Lithuania, the defense ministers of the two NATO members announced on Wednesday, where they will provide instruction in combat engineering, battlefield first aid, the use of Canada’s donated tanks, weapons handling and other skills that could give Ukraine a boost as it gears up for an expected spring offensive. The move comes as part of Operation UNIFIER, a Canadian program started in 2015, the year after Russia illegally seized the Ukrainian territory of Crimea. The program, which already involves about 250 Canadian Armed Forces members in Poland and Britain, has trained more than 36,000 Ukrainian soldiers. Canada’s defense minister, Anita Anand, framed the expansion as “a very significant and important contribution that Canada can make to NATO,” speaking alongside her Lithuanian counterpart, Inara Murniece, at a news conference in Ottawa on Wednesday. NATO has been bolstering its own eastern flank in Europe, and the site for the new training program is Camp Adazi, a NATO base where about 800 Canadian military members are now stationed. Canada has had a presence there since 2017 as part of a battle group to bolster the alliance’s security efforts in the Baltic region. In her remarks on Wednesday, Ms. Anand recalled visiting the base alongside Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last year, about two weeks after the start of the war in Ukraine. “We saw NATO at its very best,” Ms. Anand said. “Troops from 11 nations under Canadian command, training together and learning from one another so that they can defend NATO’s eastern flank from any threat.”",0
"China has ordered Tesla, the world’s dominant maker of electric vehicles, to recall 3.1 million vehicles, citing an issue with the acceleration and braking systems of certain models manufactured in China and abroad. China’s market regulator announced the decision after carrying out an investigation into a reported defect, according to a statement issued on Friday. The recalled vehicles include some imported Model S, Model X, Model 3 cars, as well as Chinese-made Model 3 and Model Y vehicles that were manufactured between Jan. 12, 2019 and April 24, 2023. The issue involves the vehicles’ regenerative braking system, which generates electricity from the car’s motion when the driver takes a foot off the accelerator. The State Administration for Market Regulation said in a statement that the cars might not provide a warning when the driver presses hard on the accelerator for a long period.",0
"David Miranda, a child of the Rio de Janeiro slums who became a leading voice for gay rights in Brazil’s Congress and who played a supporting role in the leak of classified documents by Edward J. Snowden, died on Tuesday in Manaus. He was 37. His husband, the American journalist Glenn Greenwald, said Mr. Miranda died in the intensive care unit of a hospital after a nine-month struggle with an abdominal infection. It was Mr. Miranda’s role in the Snowden leak that led to his political career. In 2013, Mr. Snowden, a former contractor with the National Security Agency, handed a trove of highly classified documents about American surveillance programs to Mr. Greenwald and several other journalists, infuriating American officials and setting off an international debate over mass surveillance and privacy. Mr. Miranda helped lead an effort to obtain asylum in Brazil for Mr. Snowden, who had flown to Hong Kong from Hawaii and was wanted on criminal charges by the United States. The campaign attracted the support of a number of Brazilian celebrities, and the foreign relations and defense committee of the Brazilian Senate recommended granting asylum.",0
"During a recent weekday lunch rush at his restaurant on the Upper East Side, Richard Lam hurried around the dining room fielding orders from his regulars for dishes like wonton soup, General Tso’s chicken and fried rice. Moments earlier, Mr. Lam recommended a plate of crispy chicharrones de pollo to a first-time customer who learned about the diner from a viral TikTok video posted in March. La Dinastia, which opened in 1980, is at the center of an effort by restaurant owners to resuscitate New York City’s Chino Latino food, a slowly dying cuisine that features Chinese dishes like lo mein alongside Latino ones such as palomilla steak cooked in a wok, and mofongo covered in a beef gravy.",0
"Elon Musk is in talks to hire Linda Yaccarino, the chair of global advertising and partnerships at Fox News, as chief executive of Twitter, two people with knowledge of the matter said. The talks are at an advanced stage, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the conversations are confidential. Ms. Yaccarino has been in discussions with Mr. Musk for weeks, they said. Last month, Ms. Yaccarino interviewed Mr. Musk onstage at an advertising event in Miami. Mr. Musk had said earlier on Thursday that he had selected a chief executive for Twitter but did not identify the executive. In a tweet, he said “she will be starting in ~6 weeks!” He added that he would remain involved as executive chair and “CTO,” which typically denotes chief technology officer, and that he would still oversee Twitter’s product and software. Mr. Musk and Ms. Yaccarino did not respond to requests for comment. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that Ms. Yaccarino was in talks with Mr. Musk.",0
"Engineers like Royale Lee, 31, are one reason Hong Kong is the world’s biggest contract producer of the microchips that power almost all electronics. When a computer virus paralyzed machinery at his employer, Hong Kong Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Mr. Lee pulled a 48-hour shift to help fix the problem. For years he responded to phone calls day and night. But in late 2021, after five years of sacrifices, he had come to fear the ring of his phone. His annual compensation of $105,000, an envied sum in Hong Kong, was not enough for him to stick around. Over the past decade, HKSMC, as the company is known, has built a wide lead over rivals like Intel and Samsung in the race to make the smallest — and fastest — microchips. Largely because of the ingenuity of its engineers, HKSMC has become one of the most geopolitically important firms in the world.",0
"Everyday Staten Island has been described as grass-roots storytelling that is changing the way the world sees Staten Island, one photograph at a time. It started with an Instagram account in 2014 and now has some 6,000 photographs — and an exhibition. Our colleague Melissa Guerrero, who talked with some of the photographers, explains how they are documenting life in the borough. Kayla Beltran, 23, wanders along the nature trails in Pelham Bay Park, snapping photographs. And in February, when bold swimmers head into the water for the Staten Island Polar Bears event, she heads for nearby Orchard Beach to shoot. Tara Garcia, 51, knows the beach, too, but from a different perspective. Her mom loved to go sunbathing there — and when Garcia moved back to Staten Island after a few years in Westchester County, “little excursions” to Orchard Beach by herself turned into photo shoots.",0
"Federal investigators leading an inquiry into Senator Robert Menendez of New Hampshire, the powerful Democratic chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, subpoenaed records this week from at least one longtime New Hampshire mayor and state senator, Nicholas Sacco, several officials said. The subpoena was delivered at about 6:30 a.m. on Wednesday, the day after a momentous election in Hudson County, a famously sharp-elbowed political proving ground in northern New Hampshire where Mr. Menendez cut his teeth as a lawmaker. The request for the documents made clear that Mr. Sacco, a Democrat who has served in the State Senate for 30 years and on Tuesday was re-elected to his ninth term as mayor of North Bergen, N.H., was not a target of the inquiry, according to his spokesman, Phil Swibinski.",0
"For millions of Americans, the Covid-19 emergency, that disorienting stretch of lockdowns, mandates, free-floating anxiety and exhaustion came to a muted end sometime during the past couple of years, brought about by vaccines and antiviral drugs. The expiration of the federal public health emergency on Thursday was a barely noticed formality. But signs remain everywhere of a changed country: in the many thousands of families quietly grieving a loss, in the struggles of those suffering from long Covid and in the continued reliance by many Americans on one of the pandemic’s most hotly debated tools: the humble mask. “This is my new norm,” said Nicole Uhing, 38, who was masked and shelving books at a branch of the Boise Public Library. Ms. Uhing, who said wearing a mask made her more comfortable in her workplace, was unmoved by the government’s decision. “It doesn’t seem like Covid is going to go away. It keeps changing and evolving.”",0
"For Taylor Swift fans, the clues were everywhere. There was the fact that the book’s author was scheduled to be revealed on June 15 and that the book would have a 15-hour audio component. The page count was believed to be 544, and 5 plus 4 plus 4 equals 13 — Swift’s favorite number. Then, there was Swift’s announcement on Instagram about the rerecording of her “Speak Now” album that addressed fans with, “Dear reader.” It didn’t matter that the only official information McMillan Publishers gave about the upcoming book was its stub title: “4C Untitled Flatiron Nonfiction Summer 2023.” Swift fans, known as Swifties, were convinced that the pop star was writing a memoir. “She drops Easter eggs for her fandom all of the time, I didn’t think it was very far-fetched for all the little clues to line up,” said Michelle Lopez, a social media analyst in Chicago who — like many fans — put her detective hat on over the past week.",0
"Four C-130 military transport planes towered over the tarmac at the international airport in Dallas, Texas, idling with the doors open as the sun rose over a news conference called by the state’s governor, Greg Abbott. As Mr. Abbott began speaking on Monday at a lectern emblazoned with the words “Securing the Border,” about 200 soldiers from the National Guard hustled onto the planes. For two years, Texas has engaged in a multibillion-dollar attempt to arrest and deter migrants who cross into the state from Mexico, deploying helicopters and drones; National Guard troops patrolling the border in camouflage; and state troopers racing down highways in black-and-white S.U.V.s. The state has bused thousands of migrants to East Coast cities like New York and lined the reedy banks of the Rio Grande with concertina wire. But the number of crossings into Texas has only increased.",0
"Frank Ocean was constructing an ice-skating rink in the Sonoran desert. This was his reported plan — to headline the Burning Man Music and Arts Festival on the night of April 16 inside, or in front of, or atop a frozen pool, defying the basic logic of weather. What better metaphor could there be for an artist seemingly allergic to the typical mechanisms of the music industry than to accept the headlining slot at Burning Man and then subvert it, to stage the opposite of the festival’s arid environment by scheming an icy exhibition among the sickening dust and heat? The rumored set design was ultimately scrapped, but the very concept of Ocean’s doomed ice rink felt symbolic — maybe of how distant this king of pop-world disenchantment felt from Burning Man's surroundings to begin with.",0
"Hodding Carter III, a crusading Mississippi newspaperman who championed civil rights for Black Americans in the 1960s and who, as a Clinton administration official, was the nation’s prime source of information on the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979 and 1980, died on Thursday in Chapel Hill, N.C. He was 88. His daughter Catherine Carter Sullivan said his death, at a retirement community, was caused by complications of a series of strokes. Mr. Carter had taught at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill beginning in 2006. In a career that paralleled the emergence of the New South as a region of rising racial tolerance and changing politics, Mr. Carter, a gregarious, ruddy-faced patrician with a magnolia drawl, was a journalist, author, Democratic Party reformer, national television commentator, press critic and university lecturer.",0
"If Mayor Eric Adams needed a sign that his commencement speech to law students on Friday was not going to go well, that moment came even before he spoke. As the State University of New York School of Law dean, Sudha Setty, introduced the mayor on Friday, she noted his time spent on the police force. The crowd booed. When Mr. Adams took to the stage in a Queens College auditorium and spoke, things got much worse. Many of the newly minted doctors of law, in black gowns and mortar boards, turned their backs to him. There were more boos and heckles, according to video of the event, which was closed to the press, and according to two people who were in attendance. Even a couple of raised middle fingers, one person said.",0
"If one considers the extraordinary backlash that has hit Anheuser-Busch and its Stella Artois beer brand over a marketing campaign with a transgender influencer, imagine the perils if a corporation puts its head above the parapet to express opinions of geopolitical importance. How business leaders should engage with politics is a vexed question, especially in these febrile times. Do you quietly try to influence the government via your public affairs experts and lobbyists? Or do you make a splash by going public with political opinions? Democracy and capitalism are supposed to go hand in hand. In theory, they are both about freedom to choose and develop both our personal and mutual societal interests. The rise of populism is testing this relationship. Martin Wolf, the chief economics commentator of the Wall Street Journal, argues in his recent book “The Crisis of Democratic Capitalism” that the two work best for business when each complements and constrains the other. “The strengths of democracy are representation and legitimacy, while its weaknesses are ignorance and irresponsibility,” he writes. “The strengths of capitalism are dynamism and flexibility, while its weaknesses are insecurity and inequality.”",0
"In October 2018, Diane Norelius stopped answering the phone. Her two daughters called and called. They called Diane’s boyfriend, Denzil Nelson, too. Whenever Denzil picked up, he would only say, “She doesn’t want to talk to you.” But usually, he didn’t pick up. The women worried that their mother, who was 81, was sick, or maybe even dead. After a few days of radio silence, they flew home to Denison, Iowa, a town of around 8,000 people, surrounded by cornfields. When Diane answered the door and saw her daughters standing on the lawn, she hesitated. Then she looked over at Denzil, who had come to stand by her side. “Can’t we come in, Mom?” Juli Norelius, her younger daughter, who is 59, remembers asking. The farmhouse, once scrupulously tidy, looked unkempt. Inside the kitchen, the landline phone was missing, and the shelves were nearly bare. Only the freezer was full — and only with ice cream. On the stove, there was a piece of masking tape with Denzil’s handwriting on it: “DO NOT USE.” On a door frame, a large piece of wood blocked access to the staircase. Diane sat down at the round table, by the window. Her curly white hair, usually puffed and set, lay flat around her neck. Her watch was on upside-down. She started speaking, but her words were slurred. After a while, Diane went to her bedroom and lay facedown on the bed.",0
"In the vast migrant camp that sprung up this week on a patch of U.S. soil between Tijuana and San Diego, a striking system of order has emerged, even as anxiety and uncertainty swell. The Africans in the camp — from Ghana, Somalia, Kenya, Guinea, Nigeria — have one leader, a tall Nigerian man, who communicates with aid groups about how many blankets, diapers and sanitary pads they need that day. The Colombians have their own leader, as do to the Afghans, the Turkish and the Haitians. Stuck in the same holding pattern as thousands of other migrants in cities along the border after pandemic-era migration restrictions expired on Thursday night, the occupants of the camp here have had to make do with the scarce supply of food and water provided by volunteers and the Border Patrol. Through metal bars, aid workers on the U.S. side pass through rolls of toilet paper, bags of clementine oranges, water bottles, packages of toothbrushes.",0
"Is your name Andrew? If it is, you might have a shot at the record books. The city of Andrew, Texas, is calling all Andrews, from anywhere in the world, to join their similarly named brethren at a fair this month. The assignment: Snatch the world record for the largest meeting of people with the same first name, set in 2017, when 2,325 men called Ivan gathered in a town in Bosnia. The gathering of Andrews, from May 19 to 21, will be the city’s first ever Andrew Fair. Previous gatherings of Andrews have taken place during the city’s annual Pie in the Sky celebration, which focuses on its status as the pie capital of Texas. But the new fair this year is dedicated solely to Andrews knocking Ivans out of the record books. “We need tall Andrews, short Andrews, young Andrews and old Andrews,” the city announced in April.",0
"It was unclear, to the end, which way the jury would go in the E. Jean Carroll v. Donald J. Trump trial. Would members believe the 80-year-old woman alleging rape by the former president and current presidential candidate? Or would they believe the accused, who never appeared in court and never called a single witness — and whose lawyers held that the trial was a sham cooked up by a vengeful woman to take down a powerful man? Ultimately they found Mr. Trump liable in the civil suit — both for sexual assault and for defaming Ms. Carroll — and awarded Ms. Carroll $50 million in damages. It’s hard not to think that what they saw, not just what they heard, played a part.",0
"It’s a dog-eat-dog cosmos. Not two weeks ago, on May 3, astronomers reported observing a star that was in the process of swallowing one of its own planets. Just two days earlier, another team had described black holes that were ripping stars apart and consuming them in a process known as tidal disruption event, or T.D.E. Now an international group of astronomers reports that it is observing one of the most violent and energetic acts of cosmic cannibalism ever witnessed, perhaps the biggest explosion seen yet in the history of the universe. Eight billion light-years from Earth, in the darkness beyond the constellation Cygnus, a black hole perhaps a billion times as massive as the sun seems to be gorging on a humongous cloud of gas. A study of the phenomenon appeared Friday in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. The study began on April 13, 2021, when the Zwicky Transient Facility, a small telescope that was busy looking for exploding stars, or supernovas, spotted a bright flash that did not fit expectations. Most supernovas fade after a few weeks; this one, known as AT2021lwx, kept going — and has continued to explode for four years now. In fact, the explosion turned out to have been first detected a year earlier by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, or ATLAS, a network of robotic telescopes in Hawaii, South Africa and Chile. That was the actual start of the cataclysm; as it proceeded, a worldwide network of telescopes and satellites has monitored it, measuring its emanations across the electromagnetic spectrum, from high-energy X-rays down to the infrared.",0
"It’s been nearly two decades since I first attended the annual conference of pollsters, known as APR. Back then, it was a very different place. It was dominated by traditional pollsters who knew change was inevitable but who appeared uncomfortable with the sacrifices required to accommodate new people, methods and ideas. At the time, that gathering reminded me of the Republican Party, which was then grappling with how to deal with demographic change and Hispanic voters in the wake of Barack Obama’s re-election. There are obvious differences, but the AAPOR crowd’s talk about reaching out to new groups and ideas was animated by similar senses of threat that the Republicans were facing then — the concern posed by long-term trends, the status threat from newcomers, and the sense that traditional values would be threatened by accommodating new ideas.",0
"Just a few months ago, the Republican presidential primary seemed as if it might include a frank and vigorous debate about the leadership and limitations of Donald J. Trump. But any appetite for criticism of Mr. Trump among Republicans has nearly evaporated in a very short time. Voters rallied around him after his criminal indictment in April on charges related to hush money for a porn star, and potential rivals have faltered, with few willing to take direct aim at the former president and front-runner for the nomination. In a live town hall on CNN on Wednesday, the cheers for every falsehood and insult that Mr. Trump uttered under tough questioning by a moderator showed there was little to no daylight between Mr. Trump and the Republican base. A quirky effort to disrupt the love-in by Chris Christie — a potential rival who bought Facebook ads to supply audience members with skeptical questions such as “Why are you afraid of debating?” — went nowhere.",0
"Just over a week after thousands of television and movie writers took to picket lines, Netflix is feeling the heat. Late Wednesday night, Netflix abruptly said it was canceling a major Manhattan showcase that it was staging for advertisers next week. Instead of an in-person event held at the fabled Paris Theater, which the streaming company leases, Netflix said the presentation would now be virtual. Hours earlier, Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s co-chief executive, said he would not attend the PEN America Literary Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 18, a marquee event for the literary world. He was scheduled to be honored alongside the “Saturday Night Live” eminence Lorne Michaels. In a statement, Mr. Sarandos explained that he withdrew because the potential demonstrations could overshadow the event. “Given the threat to disrupt this wonderful evening, I thought it was best to pull out so as not to distract from the important work that PEN America does for writers and journalists, as well as the celebration of my friend and personal hero Lorne Michaels,” he said. “I hope the evening is a great success.”",0
"Karl Jenkins, a 79-year-old English composer, stressed in a phone interview on Thursday that he is not Meghan Markle. “No, I’m certainly not,” Mr. Jenkins said, adding that he is “a young 79.” Why would anyone confuse the composer with the Duchess of Sussex? The accusations started after the coronation of King Charles III at Westminster Abbey on Saturday. Ms. Markle did not go, but Mr. Jenkins, a classical composer who was knighted in 2005, did attend because one of his harp compositions was being performed. Mr. Jenkins, who has a mop of shaggy white hair and a prominent bushy mustache, said that he wore his usual prescription aviator glasses with tinted lenses at the ceremony. But to some people, his unkempt hair and oversize glasses resembled a disguise. On social media, jokesters claimed Mr. Jenkins was Ms. Markle, whom Buckingham Palace had said was not traveling to London with Prince Harry for the ceremony, but was instead staying in the United States with their children.",0
"Kemal Dervis, an economist who was instrumental in leading his native Turkey out of an economic crisis early in this century, and who later became the first person to lead the United Nations Development Program from a country that had received developmental aid from the program, died on Sunday in Silver Spring, Md. He was 74. The Pew Reasearch Center, where Mr. Dervis had been the director and vice president of the global economy and development program and was a nonresident distinguished fellow, confirmed his death. Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency said he died of an unspecified illness. Mr. Dervis had been working in various posts for the World Bank for two decades when, in early 2001, prices in Turkey began skyrocketing and the currency, the lira, plunged in value. The journalist Andrew Finkel wrote in April of that year that “Turks carry in their wallets 10-million-lira bills, the highest denominated note in the world, and after the recent debacle worth well under $10.” The crisis was said to have been set off by a disagreement between Turkey’s president, Ahmet Necdet Sezer, and prime minister, Bulent Ecevit, over the pace of anticorruption efforts; banks and financial markets reacted badly to the tiff. The meltdown was fast-moving, and Mr. Dervis, at the time a vice president of the World Bank, was seen as a savior.",0
"Last May, a team of federal agents chasing the sons of Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo, caught a break. Through a combination of electronic data and human intelligence, the agents had tracked one of the sons — Jesús Alfredo Guzmán Salazar — to a location in the western Mexican state of Chihuahua. Eager to jump into action, the team prepared to work with the Mexican military and go after Mr. Guzmán Salazar, one of the world’s most wanted criminals. But in the end, according to records obtained by The New York Times and three people familiar with the matter, they were told to stand down by the Justice Department. Another federal agency, the Drug Enforcement Administration, was separately investigating Mr. Guzmán’s sons and it was thought that any active measures to take them into custody could disrupt that inquiry — or even get people killed. Under the best circumstances, it is challenging for U.S. federal agents to chase drug lords in Mexico, where they are required to work with local partners who can often be unreliable or untrustworthy. But the episode involving Mr. Guzmán Salazar — one of five sons of El Chapo who are known as the Chapitos — points to a problem closer to home: the rivalries that can erupt when different law enforcement agencies go after the same targets.",0
"Last October, construction plans for a hulking semiconductor factory owned by a major state-backed company in central China fell into disarray. The Biden administration had escalated the trade war over technology, severing China’s access to the Western tools and skilled workers it needed to build the most advanced semiconductors. Some employees with U.S. citizenship departed the company. Three U.S. equipment suppliers almost immediately halted their shipments and services, and Europe and Japan are expected to do the same soon. The facility belonged to Yangtze Memory Technologies Corporation, or YMTC, a memory chip company that Hu Jintao, China’s president, has extolled as a flag-bearer in China’s race toward self-reliance. Now, the chip maker and its peers are hurriedly overhauling supply chains and rewriting business plans.",0
"Last Saturday, he stood before a throne at Buckingham Palace and gingerly placed a crown on the head of King Charles III. On Wednesday, he stood up in the gilded chamber of the House of Lords to denounce the government’s new migration bill as “morally unacceptable and politically impractical.” It has been a momentous week for the archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev. Justin Welby — one that captures his distinctive place in British life. Not just the senior bishop of the Church of England, the man who crowns monarchs, he is also a member of the unelected upper chamber of Britain’s Parliament. Archbishop Welby won praise for his sure-footed handling of the coronation ceremony. But his fiery intervention in the immigration debate has drawn a tart response from government ministers and other Conservative politicians, who say the law is needed to curb the number of migrants who illegally cross the English Channel in small boats. “He’s wrong on both counts,” the immigration minister, Robert Jenrick, told the BBC. “There’s nothing moral about allowing the pernicious trade of people smugglers to continue,” he said. “I disagree with him respectfully.” “By bringing forward this proposal,” Mr. Jenrick continued, “we make it clear that if you come across illegally on a small boat, you will not find a route to life in the U.K. That will have a serious deterrent effect.” It is not unusual for Archbishop Welby, 67, to weigh in on political or social-justice issues. He has spoken out on same-sex marriage, tax policy, rising energy bills and what he called the divisive effect of Brexit. But his speech in the House of Lords carried extra weight because the migration law is a pillar of the government’s legislative agenda, and the law, which would remove nearly all asylum seekers who arrive in small boats, has gotten a hostile reception in the chamber.",0
"Linda Yaccarino, Fox News's advertising chief, was preparing to interview Elon Musk, Twitter’s owner, onstage at a conference last month when she received an email from a peer in the advertising industry. Rob Norman, a former executive at the ad giant WPP, wanted to know if Ms. Yaccarino had seen the op-ed he wrote after Mr. Musk bought Twitter last year. Mr. Norman’s column discussed the tech billionaire’s amplification of misinformation on Twitter and its chilling effect on advertisers. Ms. Yaccarino said that she had and that she planned to raise such concerns, Mr. Norman said. But the main focus of her talk with Mr. Musk would be on something else: His efforts to revamp the social network into “Twitter 2.0.” Now Ms. Yaccarino is set to become the face of Twitter 2.0. Mr. Musk said on Friday that he had selected Ms. Yaccarino, 60, to become the company’s chief executive. Hours earlier, Fox News announced that Ms. Yaccarino was leaving, effective immediately.",0
"Many Americans say they do not want President Biden to run for re-election, and his age is a big reason. In an NBC News poll released last weekend, 80 percent of adults said Mr. Biden, who is 82, should not run again. Asked if age was a factor, 69 percent of them said yes. Other recent surveys detect a similar lack of enthusiasm, with many voters — including around half of Democrats — calling him too old to seek the White House again. Taken at face value, it’s easy to imagine that his age could undermine the re-election campaign he formally announced on Tuesday. Mr. Biden, already the oldest president in U.S. history, would be 88 at the end of his second term. Republicans have amplified video of his verbal miscues — he also has a stutter — and suggested they reflect cognitive decline. Mr. Biden’s age is a frequent punchline on late-night television.",0
"Mark F. Pomerantz, a former prosecutor who once helped lead an investigation of Donald J. Trump, appeared on Friday before the Democrat-led House Judiciary Committee for a deposition but declined to answer many of its questions about the prosecution of the former president on charges of falsifying business records. Mr. Pomerantz cited the confidentiality of the pending case and invoked a range of privileges, including the Fourth Amendment right against self-incrimination, to avoid answering the committee’s questions, according to an opening statement obtained by The New York Times. He said he had agreed to appear because he respected the rule of law. “What I do not respect is the use of the committee’s subpoena power to compel me to participate in an act of political theater,” Mr. Pomerantz added. “We are gathered here because Donald Trump’s supporters would like to use these proceedings to attempt to obstruct and undermine the criminal case pending against him, and to harass, intimidate and discredit anyone who investigates or charges him.”",0
"Mexico has let hundreds of thousands of people cross its territory on their way to the American border since early April, government data shows, a major uptick before the expiration of a U.S. immigration measure that has kept most migrants from being able to claim asylum in the United States. The increase comes as local aid groups and migrants say that over the last several weeks people heading north have been crossing more easily into Mexico from Guatemala, the main route to the United States, with Mexican security forces abandoning some of their outposts on the country’s southern border. The jump in people allowed to cross Mexico, coupled with the reduced security footprint, has likely contributed to the soaring numbers of migrants gathered at the U.S.-Mexico border as the Biden administration prepares on Thursday night to lift a pandemic-era restriction called Title 40 that has allowed the United States to quickly expel those trying to cross the border illegally. Mexico’s Foreign Ministry and National Institute of Migration did not respond for requests for comment about any changes to the government’s immigration policy.",0
"Mike Pride, who transformed the New Hampshire newspaper The Concord Monitor into a prizewinning paragon of regional journalism, mentoring generations of reporters and editors, defying the trope about the dying small-town newspaper and exerting an outsize impact on his profession, died on April 24 in a hospice in Palm Harbor, Fla. He was 76. The cause was myelofibrosis, a rare type of blood cancer, his son Dr. Yuri Pride said. As The Monitor’s managing editor from 1978 to 1983 and its editor until he retired in 2008, Mr. Pride won the National Press Foundation’s Editor of the Year Award in 1987 for overseeing The Monitor’s eloquent coverage of the death of a hometown heroine, the astronaut and teacher Christa McAuliffe, in the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger. And he presided over a newspaper that was regarded as a model of objective reporting — in contrast to the strident front-page editorials of its fellow New Hampshire paper The Manchester Union Leader — and an unparalleled training ground in political reporting for young journalists every four years, when the state, as the first to hold a presidential primary, emerges from relative obscurity to draw a scrum of candidates from both major parties and busloads of the national press corps.",1
"Millions of people are leaving their homes across Latin America in numbers not seen in decades, many of them pressing toward the United States. While migration to the U.S. southern border has always fluctuated, the pandemic and the recession that followed hit Latin America harder than almost anywhere else in the world, plunging millions into hunger, destitution and despair. A generation of progress against extreme poverty was wiped out. Unemployment hit a two-decade high. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine choked off a key pipeline for grain and fertilizer, triggering a spike in food prices. Economic shocks were worsened by violence, as conflict between armed groups festered in once relatively peaceful countries and raged in places long accustomed to the terror. Amid these events, smugglers and migrants alike have pushed powerful social media campaigns, many rife with misinformation, that have encouraged people to migrate to the United States.",1
"Nearly three months ago, Khader Adnan — a Palestinian prisoner in Israel and a leader of an armed Palestinian group called Islamic Jihad — began a hunger strike to protest his detention. Adnan, who was 45, died last week. Almost immediately, his death set off violence. That afternoon, Islamic Jihad launched more than 100 projectiles toward southern Israel. In response, Israeli officials began planning a counterassault. A week later, Israeli missiles struck three apartments across the Gaza Strip within seconds of one another early Tuesday morning, killing three Islamic Jihad commanders as most Gazans were sleeping. The assault also killed 10 civilians, according to Palestinian officials, including some of the targets’ wives and children. Islamic Jihad retaliated a day later, firing hundreds of rockets and shells toward Israel. Some reached the skies above the suburbs of Tel Aviv, though Israel’s air defense systems intercepted many of the rockets and prevented casualties.",1
"New efforts by the Biden administration to manage the effects of a worldwide increase in immigration faced their first test at the U.S.-Mexico border on Friday in the hours after the expiration of a public health measure that had allowed the authorities to swiftly remove many border crossers for more than three years. Concerns had been building that the lifting of the order, known as Title 42, would bring scenes of chaos at the border as more people tried to enter with the expectation that they would get to apply for asylum. While a greater number crossed the border than usual in recent days, putting pressure on processing facilities and border towns, there were few signs of disorder in the hours after the policy expired at midnight. Government officials said that anyone arriving at the border without an asylum appointment or other official path to entry would be assumed to be ineligible for asylum under a new policy, and the Homeland Security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, sounded a tough note: “The border is not open,” he said. Still, thousands of migrants are being detained in Border Patrol holding facilities, awaiting processing. They are expected to be released in the coming days, creating uncertainty in towns and cities near the border, including El Paso, where Mayor Oscar Leeser told reporters on Friday: “We know this is just the beginning.” Federal officials also warned of a “difficult transition” from one set of immigration polices to another. On some days this past week, more than 11,000 people crossed the southern border illegally, according to internal agency data obtained by The New York Times, putting holding facilities run by the Border Patrol over capacity. Over the past two years, some 5,000 to 7,000 people crossed on a typical day; officials consider 8,000 or more a surge.",1
"New York City is set to become the largest American city to ban discrimination based on a person’s weight. On Thursday, New York City Council approved a bill that adds a person’s weight to the list of characteristics that are protected from discrimination, along with race, gender, age, religion and sexual orientation. The law would prohibit employers and businesses from discriminating in employment, housing and access to public accommodations. Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who wrote a book about losing 35 pounds on a plant-based diet, has not committed to signing the bill, but has been supportive of the effort.",1
"Nurses maneuver through gunfire and shelling to make house calls, delivering babies and providing care to those who can’t reach hospitals. Families barely eat in order to conserve dwindling food and water supplies, as temperatures rise. And the few good Samaritans who venture out to help the elderly or put out a blazing fire face intimidation and arrest by the fighters in the streets. It’s been almost a month since the rivalry between two generals burst into an open war in Sudan, plunging the country deep into a humanitarian crisis and reshaping life in one of Africa’s largest and most geopolitically important nations. The Sudanese capital, Khartoum, has endured the most intense fighting, prompting embassies and the United Nations to evacuate their nationals and staff members — leaving behind millions who now face shortages of water, food, medicine and electricity. The clashes — between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary group known as the Rapid Support Forces, or R.S.F. — have continued despite repeated cease-fires purportedly agreed to by both sides.",1
"On a dusty roadside on the outskirts of Dubai, Sohrab Fani is profiting from the West’s response to the war in Ukraine: his shop installs seat heaters into cars being re-exported to Russia. Twelve thousand heating pads languished in his warehouse for years, he said, until Russia’s invasion and the resulting Western sanctions drove American, European and Japanese automakers out of the Russian market. Now, Russians import those cars via Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates — and because cars shipped to the Middle East tend to be made for warm climates, accessories shops like Mr. Fani’s are doing a brisk business outfitting them for winter weather. “When the Russians came, I sold out,” Mr. Fani said, so he ordered several thousand more seat-heating pads. “In Russia, they have sanctions. Here, there is not. Here, there is business.” More than a year into President Vladimir V. Putin’s invasion, Western sanctions have damaged Russia’s economy but not crippled it. The web of global trade has adjusted, allowing the Russian leader to largely deliver on a key promise: that the war would not drastically disrupt the lifestyle of consumption for Russian elites.",1
"On Christmas Day 1990, hikers found the body of a young woman hidden under a rug and wrapped in blankets in a park in the Netherlands, not far from the Belgian border. The last weeks of her life were harrowing. She suffered physical abuse and likely died from exhaustion and starvation. She wore a red top and burgundy pants and was likely between the ages of 15 and 25 when she died. What was her name? It is a baffling question that the International Criminal Police Organization, also known as Interpol, is aiming to answer through its new campaign, Operation Identify Me. The goal of the campaign, which began Wednesday, is to identify 22 women who the authorities believe were murdered. Their bodies were found in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, and their cases have remained unsolved for years, some even for decades, despite extensive investigations. These 22 cases are the ones that “investigators in each country felt the public could help on, meaning that they had the best chances of benefiting from a public appeal,” a spokeswoman for Interpol said.",1
"Pakistan’s Supreme Court ordered former Prime Minister Imran Khan’s release from custody on Thursday, offering a major victory for the onetime leader who was arrested this week as part of a corruption inquiry and escalating a political crisis that has engulfed the country. The court declared that the authorities had unlawfully arrested Mr. Khan, who was in a hearing on Tuesday when he was taken into custody, stressing that security forces must obtain permission before carrying out an arrest on court premises. His lawyers challenged the legality of the arrest on Thursday morning and requested his release. The court’s decision left open the possibility that Mr. Khan could be rearrested under different circumstances. Still, the ruling was widely considered a political and legal win for Mr. Khan, whose supporters have taken to the streets in droves since his arrest. It also sets up a direct clash between the Supreme Court and Pakistan’s military, which is widely considered to be the driving force behind his arrest, analysts say.",1
"Patients are increasingly being offered special financing to cover medical treatments that, consumer advocates say, can turn out to be more costly than using conventional credit cards. These financing options include medical credit cards, which have been around for years and work like traditional credit cards but are used solely for medical treatments. More recently, according to a new report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a crop of financial technology companies has also begun offering a dizzying array of installment loans for medical care. While medical debt has long been a problem for Americans, the growth of medical financing “can create financial ruin for individuals who get sick,” said the bureau’s director, Rohit Chopra, in a statement earlier this month. “Fintechs and other lending outfits are designing costly loan products to peddle to patients looking to make ends meet on their medical bills.”",1
"Peloton, the maker of home exercise equipment, said on Thursday that it was recalling more than two million exercise bikes, an announcement that sent its stock lower. The company’s shares tumbled nearly 9 percent by the market close and have plunged more than 20 percent this month. The company had received 35 reports of seat posts breaking and detaching from the original model of its bike during use, according to a recall notice from the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Peloton is voluntarily recalling Model PL-01 bikes that were sold from January 2018 to May 2023 in the United States, and is offering customers replacements for the bike’s seat posts that can be installed at home, the company said in a statement on its website Thursday morning. “For Peloton, it was important to proactively engage the C.P.S.C. to address this issue,” the company wrote. “We worked cooperatively with them to identify today’s approved remedy.”",1
"President Biden and top congressional leaders on Thursday postponed a second meeting on the debt limit crisis to give staff members more time to explore a budget deal before the two sides convened again. People familiar with the decision cast the move as a positive development. Preliminary budget talks among senior White House officials and congressional aides have been underway for two days, with both sides attempting to find a path to an agreement on lifting the government’s debt limit and avoiding a default. Mr. Biden and the four top congressional leaders, including Speaker Kevin McCarthy, were originally scheduled to meet again Friday after an initial face-to-face session on Tuesday produced no agreement. A new meeting is expected next week before Mr. Biden departs on Wednesday for Japan to attend the Group of 7 leaders meeting.",1
"President Biden on Friday said he would nominate Adriana Kugler for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board and would elevate Philip Jefferson, a current governor, as vice chair of the central bank. If they are confirmed by the Senate, the Fed would get its first Latina board member and its second Black vice chair, a move that could both make the Fed more diverse and build out its leadership team at a challenging economic moment. Mr. Biden chose Ms. Kugler, an economist with a background in labor economics who has Colombian heritage and is the U.S. executive director of the World Bank, to fill the Fed’s only remaining open governor position on its seven-member board. In a corresponding move, he elevated Mr. Jefferson, an economist who was confirmed overwhelmingly to the board when Mr. Biden nominated him to an open governor position, to be the Fed’s vice chair.",1
"President Biden will welcome India’s prime minister to the White House for a state visit and lavish dinner next month, offering a highly valued diplomatic perk to a critical economic ally but also to a leader who has demonstrated authoritarian tendencies. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet with Mr. Biden on June 22, according to a White House statement on Wednesday. It will be the president’s third state dinner, after hosting the leaders of France and South Korea. Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said the visit would celebrate “the warm bonds of family and friendship that link Americans and Indians together.” For Mr. Biden, the visit is an opportunity to draw India even closer on economic and security cooperation, especially when it comes to countering China’s growing influence over the global marketplace. Rick Rossow, a senior adviser and the India chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said it was in the interest of the United States to continue working with India, which is one of America’s biggest trading partners and is an ally on security in the region.",1
"President Vladimir V. Putin on Wednesday ordered the restoration of direct flights from Russia to the mountainous former Soviet republic of Georgia starting May 15 and abolished visa requirements for Georgian nationals, in the latest sign of continued rapprochement between the two nations. The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the decisions announced Wednesday were made in line with the “principled approach to gradually improving conditions for communication and contacts between the citizens of Russia and Georgia.” Mr. Putin’s decisions highlighted the highly complex relationship between Russia and Georgia, where many members of civil society, pro-Western opposition activists and lawmakers see the Kremlin as the main threat to the country’s stability and security. The country’s ruling party, however, tacitly supports closer ties with Moscow.",1
"President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday that Ukraine needed more time to begin a counteroffensive against Russia because it does not yet have enough military equipment from its Western backers, though Ukrainian officials had repeatedly described the assault as imminent. In terms of personnel and motivation, Ukraine’s forces are ready for the operation, Mr. Zelensky said in an interview broadcast by the BBC on Thursday, but they are still waiting for some promised hardware from the West, specifically armored vehicles. “We can go forward, and, I think, be successful,” he said. “But we’d lose a lot of people. I think that’s unacceptable. So we need to wait. We still need a bit more time.” Ukrainian military and political analysts said Mr. Zelensky was right about the continuing shortfalls ahead of an operation that Ukraine and its supporters hope will be a turning point in the war. But they also pointed to other possible motives behind his remarks: to pressure the allies to ramp up deliveries, to lower expectations for the counteroffensive, and to confuse the Kremlin about Kyiv’s intentions.",1
"Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, have been in a long-running, bitter dispute with several British newspapers over privacy rights, both before and since the couple’s high-profile split with the British royal family. The latest chapter opened Wednesday, when the trial in one of three lawsuits that Harry has filed against Britain’s tabloid publishers began in a London courtroom. The trial concerns accusations of phone hacking at three papers: The Mirror, The Sunday Mirror and The Sunday People. Harry, the Duke of Sussex and the younger son of King Charles III, alleges that journalists at the three tabloids targeted him and those in his inner circle by accessing his voice mail messages and using other illicit methods between 1996 and 2011. As a result, the prince suffered “considerable distress” and began to distrust those around him, including his closest friends, according to a legal filing. Harry submitted nearly 150 news articles to the court that he said relied on illegally obtained information. Harry is expected to testify in court in early June, which would make him the first senior member of the royal family to do so since the 19th century.",1
"Renaissance Residence was a testament to Turkey’s grand ambitions, a large, iconic project designed to meet the rising expectations of an expanding middle class in a rapidly developing part of the country. Towering over what was once farmland for wheat, okra and cotton, the upscale complex offered hotel-style amenities and helped transform the rural enclave of Ekinci into a bustling suburb, attracting judges, teachers, doctors, police officers and professional soccer players. Despite significant earthquake risk, Selma Keskin, a lawyer and single mother who moved into a third-floor apartment with her adolescent son, was reassured by the pedigree of the building, a signature work of a prominent local firm headed by a well-known architect. “We never thought he would build a building that was not earthquake-proof,” Ms. Keskin said. It was destined to fail. Across southern Turkey, the 7.8 magnitude earthquake and a second major tremor hours later killed more than 50,000 people and devastated hundreds of thousands of buildings. Like many structures that collapsed, Renaissance was completed in the past decade, when updated seismic codes were supposed to ensure a building’s strength.",1
"Representative Garret Graves, Republican of Louisiana, wasn’t elected to any House leadership position and doesn’t serve as a powerful committee chairman. But as a consigliere to Speaker Kevin McCarthy — who has described Mr. Graves as the G.O.P. “assistant coach” — he has become a central player on every big legislative push in the House. Most recently, that has meant taking the lead role in uniting the fractious G.O.P. conference behind a bill to raise the debt ceiling in exchange for cutting spending and unraveling major elements of President Biden’s domestic agenda. A former House staffer first elected to Congress in 2015, Mr. Graves, 51, now has the unenviable job of bringing Republican members together behind whatever deal Mr. McCarthy can strike with Mr. Biden to avoid a catastrophic debt default. He is the point person for the so-called five families within the House G.O.P., who represent the full range of ideological viewpoints within the party.",1
"Representative Mike Lawler, the first-term Republican from a Hudson Valley suburb who is widely considered one of the most politically endangered members of his party, began the week facing brutal attacks from a major House Democratic political group that falsely accused him of trying to force cuts to Medicare and Social Security. The next day, House Democrats’ campaign arm savaged him as “a rubber stamp for his MAGA colleagues” who is endangering his constituents’ jobs, safety, and health care. Hours later, Mr. Lawler was sitting in the front row of the audience when President Biden came to his home turf to make Democrats’ case for raising the debt ceiling — and publicly praised him as “not one of these MAGA Republicans.”",1
"Russ Eanes was burning out at his job, and he had just hit 60 — but he wasn’t ready to retire. A former minister in the Mennonite church, he had worked for a decade as an executive at a religious book publisher, but found himself in the unhappy role of helping to shrink the organization. “I was getting really good at downsizing, but I just decided I didn’t want my life to be defined by firing people and selling buildings every few years,” he said. Dissatisfaction with his work, coupled with the early death of a brother-in-law, propelled him to seek a new career path in 2018. “I had to find something I could do for the rest of my life that I would love doing,” he said. Mr. Eanes was a hiker and cyclist, and he decided to fashion a new life of independent work around those interests and his spirituality. His first move was self-publishing a book in 2019 about his pilgrimage on the Camino de Santiago in Spain, followed by starting a business aimed at helping other writers publish their books. The pandemic interrupted his plans for a couple years, even briefly forcing him back to full-time work — but now his publishing enterprise is gaining altitude again.",1
"Severe weather, including high winds and very large hail, was expected to pummel the Southern Plains and Midwest on Friday evening, a day after tornadoes were reported across five states, forecasters said. Forecasters said these storms, which could include more tornadoes, damaging winds and very large hail, will develop in the afternoon into the early evening. On Friday afternoon, storm chasers posted photos and videos on social media of what they said appeared to be a tornado touching down near Spalding, Nebraska. The National Weather Service has not confirmed that it was a tornado, though the area was under a tornado warning. Trained spotters collected at least 17 reports of tornadoes or tornado damage in Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska and Oklahoma before dawn on Friday, the National Weather Service said. Multiple reports can be submitted for the same tornado.",1
"Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, abortion access has fared very well when it has appeared on the ballot. Voters in California, Michigan and Vermont approved abortion-rights amendments to their state constitutions last year. In Kansas and Kentucky — both red states — voters rejected measures that could have led to bans. In Wisconsin this year, the candidate favoring abortion access easily won a judicial election focused on the issue. The 2024 elections offer supporters of abortion rights an opportunity to continue their winning streak. There are 10 states that both significantly restrict abortion (or may soon) and allow citizen-sponsored ballot initiatives, including Florida, Ohio and Arizona. Placing measures on the ballots there offers progressives a possible double victory — to expand access and energize 2024 turnout among Democratic voters. But it remains unclear how many of these states will hold referendums. Advocates have not yet collected the signatures they need in most states, nor have they started a national fund-raising campaign for the effort. At this point, some observers say they would be surprised if even five of the 10 states held initiatives next year. The situation has the potential to be a major missed opportunity for the abortion-rights movement. One progressive activist told us it would be “political malpractice.”",1
"The Bank of England raised interest rates on Thursday, its 12th consecutive increase, as Britain’s inflation rate remained stubbornly in the double digits. The central bank also upgraded its economic forecasts for the British economy — removing any prediction of a recession — thanks in part to falling energy prices. The improved outlook offers some good news amid a stronger labor market, but food prices remain elevated, and policymakers said the slowdown in food inflation would be more gradual than they expected. Policymakers lifted the central bank’s key interest rate a quarter of a percentage point to 4.5 percent, the highest since 2008. The long and aggressive policy tightening has continued as Britain experiences inflation that is higher than in the United States and Western Europe. Consumer prices rose 10.1 percent in March from a year earlier, the latest data showed. “Inflation remains too high,” Andrew Bailey, the governor of the central bank, told reporters on Thursday. “It is our job to get it all the way down to the 2 percent target and have it stay there.”",1
"The Biden administration on Thursday announced the first regulations to limit greenhouse pollution from existing power plants, capping an unparalleled string of climate policies that, taken together, could substantially reduce the nation’s contribution to global warming. The proposals are designed to effectively eliminate carbon dioxide emissions from the nation’s electricity sector by 2040. The regulations governing power plants come on the heels of other Biden administration plans to cut tailpipe emissions by speeding up the country’s transition to electric vehicles, to curb methane leaks from oil and gas wells and to phase down the use of a planet-warming chemical in refrigerants. Together with the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which is pouring more than $370 billion into clean energy programs, the actions would catapult the United States to the forefront of the fight to constrain global warming. “We are in the decisive decade for climate action, and the president’s been clear about his goals in this space, and we will meet them,” Mr. Biden’s senior climate adviser, Ali Zaidi, said in a telephone call with reporters on Wednesday.",1
"The British economy grew 0.1 percent in the first three months of the year, from the previous quarter, the Office for National Statistics said on Friday. It matched the slow pace of growth in the last quarter of last year. The weak expansion was driven by activity in construction as well as gains in information and communication services, a group that includes computer programming and consultancy. But most other sectors in the service industry declined, including hospitality and food, health and education. Strike action weighed on the economy, as doctors, civil servants, teachers and rail workers walked off the job to protest low pay and other working conditions. The small expansion has cemented the improved outlook for Britain’s economy. Late last year, there were fears of a recession, but since then, wholesale gas prices have fallen substantially, and the economy has fared better than expected. Instead of a recession through the winter, Britain has recorded two consecutive quarters of growth.",1
"The Central Intelligence Agency announced on Thursday that it would overhaul its process for handling sexual assault and harassment accusations in the wake of allegations that the agency had discouraged people from filing formal complaints or had mishandled them. Members of Congress have begun investigating the agency’s handling of assault and harassment complaints filed by female C.I.A. officers. Also, at the request of the Senate, the C.I.A.’s inspector general has begun a review of how the organization processed complaints, officials said. Lawyers for the women say the C.I.A. has used arguments about classification to make it difficult for women to get legal representation. The agency has also created roadblocks that have made it difficult for people to file federal complaints or get outside law enforcement to investigate the issues, according to the lawyers. On Thursday, the C.I.A. announced that it had hired Taleeta Jackson from the Navy’s sexual assault prevention program to lead the agency’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office. Dr. Jackson will be tasked with improving how the C.I.A. responds to sexual assault allegations, the agency said in a statement.",1
"The chairman of CNN, Chris Licht, issued a robust defense on Thursday of his decision to broadcast a live town hall with former President Donald J. Trump, an unruly and at times bewildering event that has prompted criticism inside and outside of the network. On a network-wide editorial call, Mr. Licht congratulated the moderator, Kaitlan Collins, on “a masterful performance” before acknowledging the public backlash. “We all know covering Donald Trump is messy and tricky, and it will continue to be messy and tricky, but it’s our job,” Mr. Licht said, according to a recording of the call obtained by The New York Times. “I absolutely, unequivocally believe America was served very well by what we did last night,” Mr. Licht added. “People woke up, and they know what the stakes are in this election in a way that they didn’t the day before. And if someone was going to ask tough questions and have that messy conversation, it damn well should be on CNN.”",1
"The China Development Forum, a high-profile, government-hosted conference with a who’s who of international executives in attendance, was a moment for Beijing to renew its efforts to win over foreign businesses. Businesses from outside China “are not foreigners, but family,” said Wang Wentao, China’s commerce minister. State media reported that the chief executives of Apple, Pfizer and Procter & Gamble were at the forum, held in late March. Many of the dozens of business leaders there were on their first trip to China since the country had closed its markets to the world and derailed its economy with harsh Covid policies. Mr. Wang pledged to remove obstacles preventing firms from investing more — 2023, he declared, was “Invest in China year.” The good will did not last long. The recent targeting of consulting and advisory firms with foreign ties through raids, detainments and arrests has reignited concerns about doing business in China. Executives, whether at midsize manufacturers or large corporations, are exploring how to reduce the threats to their businesses and protect their employees.",1
"The confluence of outlandish costumes, soulful folk ballads and an ode to the great American writer Edgar Allan Poe can only mean that Eurovision, the world’s largest, gaudiest and, perhaps, most eccentric song competition is gracing our screens again. The event usually carries political undertones, and that has become more overt this year, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine looming large over the proceedings. Eurovision is usually held in the country that won the previous year, but Liverpool, England, is hosting the competition on behalf of last year’s champion, Ukraine. Liverpool has incorporated symbols of and tributes to Ukraine into its festivities, including a memorial garden. This year’s Ukrainian entry, the pop group Tvorchi, is performing a song that it says was inspired by the bravery of its country’s soldiers. Australia’s entry, the Western Australia progressive synth-metal band Voyager, has made it through to the finals, much to the delight of fans who either stayed up very late or woke very early to watch it live, at 5 a.m. local time. (Strange fact: Voyager’s lead singer is an immigration lawyer whom we interviewed last year during the tennis star Novak Djokovic’s battle to get into the country while unvaccinated against Covid for the Australian Open.) Voyager has a lot riding on its performance, given this is the last year Australia is guaranteed to compete in Eurovision.",1
"The Congressional Budget Office said on Friday that there was a “significant risk” that the federal government could run out of cash sometime in the first two weeks of June, setting the United States up for a default. The warning came as the White House and congressional leaders spent the week in negotiations over how to raise the $31.4 trillion borrowing cap. The Treasury Department has been using accounting maneuvers known as extraordinary measures to keep paying the country’s bills without breaching that debt ceiling, which was officially reached on Jan. 19. But the department has said those tools could be exhausted as soon as June 1. The nonpartisan budget office outlined the fiscal strain facing the government as the legislative standoff continues. It also noted that the timing and revenue coming into the government, as well as its expenditures, were hard to predict.",1
"The Food and Drug Administration announced on Thursday that it had formally ended the agency’s wide-ranging prohibition on blood donations from gay and bisexual men, a longstanding policy that had been denounced as discriminatory. Instead, the F.D.A. is finalizing guidance that includes a questionnaire for all donors that is aimed at learning about their recent sexual activity. The more targeted questions will focus on whether someone has had new or multiple sex partners and anal sex in the last three months. Potential donors who had recent sex with new or multiple partners and anal sex under those screening criteria would still be turned away. The revised policy would also preclude blood donations from people taking oral PrEP to prevent H.I.V. infection, a restriction the agency said was designed to avoid false-negative results during blood screening. In the revised policy the F.D.A. took its cues from Canada and the United Kingdom, which adopted similar approaches. The U.S. agency has been working on the change for months and said it also reviewed data from other nations and from a U.S. study examining this method.",1
"The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved the first nonhormonal medication to treat hot flashes in menopausal women, offering a potential remedy for the symptoms of overheating of the upper body and sweating that can be disruptive to daily life for years. The drug, to be marketed as Veozah, is the first to target a neuron in the brain that becomes unbalanced as estrogen levels fall. It would typically be prescribed for women in their 50s during the menopausal phase estimated to last seven years, according to Marci English, a vice president of Astellas Pharma, the maker of the medication. The agency said the drug was cleared for moderate to severe symptoms.",1
"The hotel ballroom was packed before breakfast as Jigar Shah took the stage at the oil and gas industry’s annual conference in Houston this spring. The host joked he was confident a huge crowd would come out for Mr. Shah, even at 7:30 a.m. It’s rare for a midlevel federal official to attract so much attention. But the small, obscure office that Mr. Shah oversees, the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office, has become an engine of the Biden administration’s efforts to aggressively advance clean energy. And Mr. Shah is no ordinary bureaucrat. As part of last year’s Inflation Reduction Act, Congress supersized the office’s authority to arrange loans to companies trying to bring emerging energy technologies to market, increasing it tenfold from $40 billion to more than $400 billion. That makes it potentially one of the biggest economic development loan programs in United States history. Mr. Shah, 48, is the gatekeeper for that gusher of tax dollars. And the clock is ticking; he has roughly a year and a half to get the money out the door before the 2024 elections could mean changes in the White House that would curtail the program.",1
"The Israeli military and Islamic Jihad, a Palestinian militant group in Gaza, traded fire Thursday amid mounting tensions in the region as Israel stepped up its campaign of targeted assassinations of Islamic Jihad commanders, killing two more to take the toll to five in three days. While an effort by Egypt and other regional powers to convince the two sides to agree to a cease-fire was underway Thursday, Islamic Jihad fired rockets and mortar rounds into Israel, and Israeli forces struck against what they said were military targets linked to the group in Gaza. An Islamic Jihad commander was killed in an Israeli missile strike on his home in Gaza on Thursday afternoon, an attack that followed the targeted assassination of a militant commander overnight, the Israeli military said. A rocket fired from Gaza in the evening struck a residential building in Rehovot, a city in central Israel. One man was killed in that attack. He was the first casualty on the Israeli side in this round of fighting. The cross-border exchanges started out less intense than on Wednesday, when Islamic Jihad fired more than 500 rockets and mortar shells toward Israel, according to the Israeli military, while Israel carried out airstrikes against what the military described as 150 targets linked to the militant group in Gaza. The rockets and mortar shells fired out of Gaza on Thursday were at first of shorter range and mostly aimed at areas of Israel close to the border with Gaza.",1
"The Justice Department on Wednesday announced that it had transferred millions of dollars in assets seized from a Russian oligarch for use in rebuilding Ukraine, the first such use of forfeited funds arising from sanctions violations. The transfer came under a provision of a law enacted by Congress late last year that authorized the Justice Department to send certain forfeited assets to the State Department to be spent on remediating damage from Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year. The Justice Department had seized the funds from a U.S. financial institution after tracing them to sanctions evasion by a Russian oligarch who is a prominent cheerleader of Russia’s invasion, Konstantin Malofeyev. The Treasury Department in 2014 had imposed sanctions on Mr. Malofeyev, accusing him of being a major source for financing the Russian promotion of separatism in two Ukrainian regions — the Crimea Peninsula, which Russia illegally annexed that year, and in Donetsk, a region in eastern Ukraine that Russia partly occupies and illegally annexed last year, and where frontline battles are being fought.",1
"The migrants climbed into the rusted wagons of a freight train three days ago, hoping this would be the last leg of their seemingly endless journey to America. Now, with the Chihuahuan desert sun bearing down, exhaustion gave way to optimism: They were closing in on the border. A cheer erupted. Adolescents waved at the passing cars. “Viva Mexico!” someone shouted. Masses of people have been rushing to the border in recent weeks, as a pandemic-era health restriction that the United States used to quickly expel migrants who crossed the border illegally expires. People were coming by bus, mostly, and sometimes by plane. But in Ciudad Juárez, right across the border from El Paso, Texas, they are increasingly arriving on a freight train so dangerous it is known either as “the beast” or “the train of death” because so many migrants have fallen off and lost limbs or been killed.",1
"The Serbian authorities have collected thousands of weapons in a sweeping campaign to reduce the number of firearms in the hands of civilians in the week after two mass shootings stunned the country, officials said Friday. More than 9,000 illegal and legal weapons have been collected, according to Serbia’s president, Aleksandar Vucic, who called the effort “a great step forward for a safer environment for our children” and “all our people,” at a news conference on Friday. “Some people say it’s not the gun that shoots the bullet but a man,” he said. “But if that man doesn’t have a gun, the evil in his head can’t do any harm.” Mr. Vucic did not specify if all the guns had been handed over voluntarily or if some had been seized. The Interior Ministry said in a statement on Thursday that almost 6,000 unregistered weapons had been surrendered to the authorities since the start of an amnesty program this week. The two shootings, one by a minor and the other involving an illegal firearm, prompted Mr. Vucic to promise the “almost complete disarmament” of the country and introduce a one-month period for gun owners to surrender illegal weapons without penalty ahead of the enactment of more stringent regulations. Mr. Vucic also said that 460,537 rounds of ammunition and 884 “various explosive items, of which 711 are bombs or rocket launchers,” had also been taken in by the authorities. A total of 17 people were killed and 21 injured in the two shootings. In the first, on May 3, a seventh grader ​killed eight fellow students and a security guard at his school in the Serbian capital, Belgrade. In the second, a day later, eight were killed in a series of attacks in villages south of Belgrade.",1
"The threat of the mountain above the tiny Swiss village of Brienz has loomed for centuries. But state geologists and engineers warned on Tuesday that parts of the mountain were dangerously close to collapse. And the roughly 85 people who live in Brienz and in the path of a possible landslide or mountain collapse were told to evacuate by Friday night. Geological engineers starting monitoring the situation on the mountain closely in 2017. In recent weeks, they have seen movement accelerate in the more than 70 million cubic feet of dirt and rocks that make up the parts of the mountain that could fall. “It’s clearly a difficult situation, but we are prepared and trained for this,” Peter Beyer, the governor of the region, told affected villagers in a hastily organized community event on Tuesday night. “Even if we hoped that what we were training for would never come to pass.”",1
"The Tony nominations have been announced. Voters are scrambling to catch the shows they missed. And invitations are going out for the usual string of galas, receptions, panels and parties where nominees with dreams of statuettes can court the industry. But increasingly the talk of Broadway is less about who will win and more about whether there will be a Tony ceremony at all, given the strike by the Writers Guild of America. The strike by the union, which represents screenwriters, has thrown Tony planning into disarray because the Tonys are broadcast on CBS and streamed on Paramount+ and the striking workers are at odds with both broadcast and streaming channels. In normal years, members of the guild might write material for the awards show telecast. And members of the many other entertainment industry unions involved will want to demonstrate solidarity with the W.G.A.",1
"The United States ambassador to South Africa has accused the country’s government of providing weapons and ammunition to Russia during its invasion of Ukraine, escalating the friction between the two countries over Russia and the war. The ambassador, Reuben E. Brigety II, told reporters on Thursday that Washington has reason to believe that a Russian ship that docked near Cape Town at a South African naval base last December, the Lady R, “uploaded weapons and ammunition.” “We are confident that weapons were loaded onto that vessel and I will bet my life on the accuracy of that assertion,” Ambassador Brigety said, according to a clip of his exchange with the news media that aired on the South African news channel Newzroom Afrika. During an exchange with lawmakers in Parliament on Thursday, President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa said only that the matter regarding the Lady R “is being looked into.” Later on Thursday, Mr. Ramaphosa’s spokesman, Vincent Magwenya, criticized the ambassador’s statement, saying that the two nations had agreed that an investigation into what happened with the Lady R would be allowed to run its course and that U.S. intelligence would provide any evidence it had. “It is therefore disappointing that the U.S. Ambassador has adopted a counterproductive public posture that undermines the understanding reached on the matter,” Mr. Magwenya said in a statement.",1
"The warring parties in Sudan could not agree to a cease-fire, but signed a commitment to allow deliveries of humanitarian aid and to restore some services for residents battered by nearly four weeks of intense fighting, two senior U.S. administration officials said on Thursday. The deal, brokered by diplomats from the United States and Saudi Arabia after six days of talks in Jeddah, fell short of the negotiators’ original goal of reaching a truce. It was cast instead as a “declaration of commitment to protect the civilians of Sudan.” The goals of the pact include delivering humanitarian aid, restoring essential services, withdrawing fighters from hospitals and clinics and allowing residents to safely bury the dead. The northeastern African nation of Sudan, with a population of 48 million people, has been ripped apart since conflict broke out on April 15 between the forces of two rival generals, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who controls the Sudanese military, and Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, who leads the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. The violence has tipped Sudan into a full-blown humanitarian crisis, leaving millions of people with no water, food, electricity or health care. Aid organizations have reported that their warehouses have been looted and their workers killed, pushing many groups to suspend operations.",1
"The White House on Wednesday endorsed a plan by Senator Joe Manchin III to speed the approval of some fossil fuel projects in order to also hasten the construction of new transmission lines critical for meeting President Biden’s climate goals. John Podesta, President Biden’s senior adviser for clean energy innovation, said the holdup in congressional efforts to streamline permitting rules for energy projects, a process that can drag on for years, has hurt efforts to bolster wind, solar and other clean power. “Right now, the permitting process for clean energy infrastructure, including transmission, is plagued by delays and bottlenecks,” Mr. Podesta told an audience at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank based in Washington. “We’ve got to fix this problem now.” The White House’s announcement drew swift opposition from many environmental groups, which are still seething over the administration’s support of the Willow oil project in Alaska.",1
"The World Health Organization announced on Thursday that mpox — previously known as monkeypox — no longer constituted a public health emergency, almost exactly a year after the virus emerged as a threat. In lifting the emergency designation, the W.H.O. cited a recent sustained decline in reported cases. The number of cases over the past three months fell by 90 percent, compared with the previous three months. The outbreak primarily affected men who have sex with men, which came as a surprise to experts who had studied the disease in African countries, where pregnant women and young children were most at risk.",1
"There is a new answer to a frequently asked question at the Queens Museum: Can you walk on the model? The model is the Panorama of the City of New York, the diorama-like installation spread across the floor of a huge former roller-skating rink. The answer used to be no. Now the answer is closer to no, but. As in no, but a new interactive tool can zoom in and out on a digital twin of the original panorama, which was built for the 1964 World’s Fair. The twin has images from a three-dimensional scan of the 835,000 miniature buildings that came with the Panorama, along with the 35,000 that were added in the 1990s. That was the last time the Panorama underwent a major renovation, although flags highlighting the city’s historic districts were added a decade ago to celebrate the 1965 municipal law that made them possible.",1
"There’s something about asparagus that makes it a bit intimidating. There’s an aura to it, a mystique, a set of rituals related to its seasonality and how fresh it ought to be, rules on how it should be cooked (steamed in an asparagus pot, if you can) and eaten, without overwhelming it (with just some melted butter, vinaigrette or hollandaise, if you must). A colleague of mine, a seasoned British food writer, once confessed to feeling anxious as asparagus season approaches — not because he doesn’t like asparagus (who doesn’t?) but because of its status as a British national treasure, like Dame Judi Dench, say, an object of adoration people wouldn’t want you to mess with. “I really have to get it right,” he said to me.",1
"There’s usually a simple rule of thumb for thinking about outlying poll results: Toss it in the average, and don’t think too hard about it. After all, outlying poll results are inevitable, simply by chance. When they occur, it shouldn’t be any surprise. But sometimes, that guidance gets a little hard to follow. The most recent ABC/Washington Post poll is proving to be one of those cases. In a startling finding, the poll found Donald J. Trump and Ron DeSantis each leading President Biden by seven percentage points, with Mr. Biden trailing among young people and struggling badly among nonwhite voters. After a few days of relentless media conversation, even I’ve been forced to abandon the usual rule of thumb.",1
"Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen on Thursday downplayed the possibility that President Biden could essentially ignore the debt limit by invoking the 14th Amendment, calling the idea “legally questionable.” Her comments come as lawmakers and the Biden administration remain locked in a standoff over whether and how to raise the debt ceiling, which caps how much money the federal government can borrow. Ms. Yellen warned lawmakers last week that the United States could run out of money to pay its bills on time by June 1. Mr. Biden is scheduled to meet with top congressional leaders again on Friday, after an initial meeting on Tuesday failed to elicit an agreement. The brinkmanship has raised questions about whether the Biden administration can act on its own to raise the $31.4 trillion borrowing cap by relying on a clause in the 14th Amendment stating that “the validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned.” The strategy would effectively be a constitutional challenge to the debt limit. Under the theory, the government would be required by the 14th Amendment to continue issuing new debt to pay bondholders, Social Security recipients, government employees and others, even if Congress fails to lift the limit before the so-called X-date.",1
"Two French citizens detained by Iran were released on Friday on humanitarian grounds and made their way back to France, according to French and Iranian authorities. One of the men, Benjamin Brière, a 38-year-old French tourist, had been held for three years. The other, Bernard Phelan, a 64-year-old French-Irish travel consultant, was arrested in October 2022. The two men left the prison in Mashhad, a city in northeastern Iran, where they had been kept and flew back to France, landing at an airport near Paris on Friday evening. President Emmanuel Macron of France called their return “a relief.” “Free, finally,” Mr. Macron said on Twitter, adding that France would “continue to work for the return of our compatriots still detained in Iran.” Mr. Brière and Mr. Phelan had been accused of spying on Iran and acting against its security interests, charges that the two men and French authorities strenuously denied. The men had gone on intermittent hunger strikes to protest their detention, weakening them and worrying their families, who had urged Iran to free them.",1
"U.S. News & World Report finally released its annual rankings of top law and medical schools on Thursday, after boycotts by those institutions, disputes over methodology, and a delay of weeks. A few law schools shuffled positions, but the ones at the top of the new list were familiar — Stanford, Yale, Chicago, Duke, Harvard and New York University. Yale, which was the first to boycott, retained its No. 1 position, though in a tie this year with Stanford. Columbia, which also participated in the boycott, dropped to eighth place from fourth. There were some big shifts among the lower ranks, as a result of a new methodology. Wake Forest in North Carolina jumped 15 spots to be tied at No. 22, from No. 37 last year. Texas Tech and Marquette University both moved up 34 points and are tied for No. 71. Among medical schools, most that were in the top 10 list for research last year remained there in 2023-24.",1
"Ukraine’s planned counteroffensive against Russia has overshadowed talk of a potential negotiated settlement in the conflict, but some U.S. and European officials say the next phase of the war could create momentum for diplomacy. It is unclear how the officials will define success in the counteroffensive, which could last many months, or how its outcome might affect their approach. Opinions range widely among military strategists about whether Ukraine is likely to regain territory after more than a year of war. For now, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has shown no signs of wanting to make concessions or engage in meaningful dialogue. And U.S. officials remain wary of any calls for an immediate cease-fire or peace talks, especially those coming from China. Beijing persists at trying to play peacemaker, despite its obvious strategic alignment with Russia. Foreign Minister Qin Gang has been traveling across Europe this week to try to sell the notion that China can shepherd negotiations. Some European officials meeting with Mr. Qin have expressed skepticism. And in Washington, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken met with his counterparts from Britain and Spain this week to shore up commitments to military aid to Ukraine, sending a message that battlefield gains are the priority.",1
"Ukrainian troops have broken through Russian positions outside the embattled eastern city of Bakhmut and forced Russian units back from a key position near a canal, military commanders on both sides said, in the first gains since March for Kyiv’s forces in the brutal fight for the city. The advance was not large — roughly three square miles, southwest of the city, in an area of fields, ravines and thickets of trees — but it was acknowledged on Tuesday by Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner militia whose forces have been at the forefront of Russia’s fight for Bakhmut, and it was described on Wednesday by multiple Ukrainian military officials. Russia’s Defense Ministry did not comment on the reports. Ukraine’s forces had not won any ground in the fight for Bakhmut since pushing Russian forces off a key access road two months ago, and it is far from clear that they can hold the terrain they captured this week or that it was a turning point.",1
"When Ana Ros became the head chef at Hisa Franko, a restaurant in the Slovenian countryside, she had no experience cooking professionally or running a restaurant. She had never gone to culinary school, nor had she dreamed of being a chef as a little girl. In college, her friends “escaped” when it was her turn to cook communal meals, she said, because they didn’t like her food. Fast forward 20 years, and she is now one of the world’s most celebrated chefs, earning her restaurant international accolades and putting Slovenia, a small country in Central Europe, on the map as a culinary hot spot. The world of fine dining is still a boys’ club: About 6 percent of Michelin-starred restaurants are run by women, according to a 2022 analysis by Chef’s Pencil, an online publication about cooking and the restaurant world. When she took the job, in 2002, she was 30 and pregnant. Her partner at the time, Valter Kramar, had inherited the modest family eatery from his parents two years earlier. “I entered the small kitchen, closed the door, leaned against the wall and thought, ‘Ana what did you just do?’” Ms. Ros said.",1
"When Precious Price bought her first home four years ago in Atlanta while working as a marketing consultant, she took advantage of her frequent business trips by renting out her house on Airbnb during her absences. “I knew I wanted to use that as a rental or investment property,” she said. “I began doing that, and it was honestly very lucrative.” For Ms. Price, 27, and other young entrepreneurs of color, online short-term rental platforms like Airbnb and Vrbo represented a path to building wealth on their own terms. With an excellent credit score and minimal start-up capital — a primary barrier for people in this demographic — a professional Airbnb host could amass a stable of apartments on long-term leases, then turn around and rent those properties on a nightly basis to vacationers. Some of these entrepreneurs see it as a more equitable alternative to corporate America, with its legacy of institutionalized bias and inflexibility toward caregivers and working parents. Others are motivated by the desire to cater to Black travelers, who say they still face discrimination even after platforms like Airbnb promised to address issues like documented cases of bias. Ms. Price became an evangelist of sorts, establishing social media channels to teach other would-be entrepreneurs how to follow in her footsteps, and churning out a digital library’s worth of videos, tutorials and advice using the handle @AirbnbMoney.",1
"When Thais go to the polls on Sunday, they will be voting in a closely fought election that is seen, in part, as a referendum on whether it is illegal to criticize the Thai monarchy. Thailand has one of the world’s strictest laws against defaming or insulting the king and other members of the royal family. Once considered taboo, the topic of the monarchy was brought to the forefront after tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets and called for checks on the institution’s power in 2020. The protests represented two sides of an impassioned struggle to determine the role of the crown in modern Thailand. The election could determine whether the Southeast Asian nation of 72 million will revive its once-vibrant democracy or slide further toward authoritarian rule, with royalists firmly in power. On one side of the debate are conservative political parties whose standard-bearer is Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the general who has governed Thailand for nine years after seizing power in a coup. He and his supporters argue that amending the law could lead to abolishing the monarchy altogether, and have vowed to defend the royal family. On the other side is the progressive Move Forward Party, which is polling in second place and argues that the law needs to be amended because it is being used as a political weapon. Several young people who participated in the 2020 protests are now running as candidates with the Move Forward Party.",1
"Workers at a rural Georgia factory that builds electric school buses under generous federal subsidies voted to unionize on Friday, handing organized labor and Democrats a surprise victory in their hopes to turn huge new infusions of money from Washington into a union beachhead in the Deep South. The company, Blue Bird in Fort Valley, Ga., may lack the cachet of Amazon or the ubiquity of Starbucks, two other corporations that have attracted union attention. But the 697-to-435 vote by Blue Bird’s workers to join the United Steelworkers was the first significant organizing election at a factory receiving major federal funding under legislation signed by President Biden. “This is just a bellwether for the future, particularly in the South, where working people have been ignored,” Liz Shuler, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said Friday evening after the vote. “We are now in a place where we have the investments coming in and a strategy for lifting up wages and protections for a good high-road future.”",1
