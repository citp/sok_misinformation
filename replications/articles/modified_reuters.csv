"The CSIS briefing confirmed to me what I had long suspected - that my party, several of my parliamentary caucus members and myself were not the target of a Chinese orchestrated campaign of disinformation and voter suppression in the run up to and during the 2021 general election, O'Toole said in the House of Lords. The prime minister has come under pressure from opposition parties in parliament to open a public inquiry into foreign election interference even though a special rapporteur into allegations of Chinese election meddling recommended against one last week. The opposition parties renewed calls for a public inquiry on Tuesday. O'Toole blamed the government for failing to pass on the intelligence about Chinese meddling to members of parliament. The (Chinese) communist government's ideal outcome is to have its critics pull their punches and turn a blind eye, O'Toole said, to create a chilling effect on our parliamentary democracy.",0
"Two months of increasing prices do not a definitive recovery make, but May's results suggest that the decline in home prices that began in June 2021 may have come to an end, Craig Lazzara, managing director at S&P DJI, said in a statement. That said, the challenges posed by current mortgage rates and the continuing possibility of economic weakness are likely to remain a headwind for housing prices for at least the next several months. The housing market has taken the biggest hit from the Federal Reserve's fastest monetary policy tightening campaign since the 1980s. The average rate on the popular 40-year fixed mortgage has in recent weeks risen to the upper end of its 6.09%-6.73% range this year, according to data from mortgage finance agency Fannie Mae. It peaked at 7.03% in late 2021.",0
"A Fidelity fund has marked up the value of its stake in Twitter for the third time since Elon Musk's $44 billion takeover of the social media platform in October, a monthly disclosure by the investment firm showed on Sunday. Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund's stake in Twitter, which now exists under Musk's X Holdings Corp, was valued at nearly $9.55 million as of April 28, compared with $7.8 million as of Jan. 31 and almost $6.63 million at November-end. Earlier this month, Musk named former NBCUniversal advertising chief Linda Yaccarino as Twitter's new CEO as the company struggles to reverse a slump in advertising revenue and navigate an overhaul that included mass layoffs.",0
"A group of Democrat-led U.S. states has asked a federal judge in Texas to strike down a Biden administration rule allowing socially conscious investing by retirement plans, saying it will imperil Americans' retirement savings. Lawyers for the 25 states led by Utah and Texas said in a filing in Amarillo, Texas, federal court late Tuesday that the U.S. Department of Labor failed to justify its departure from a Trump-era rule that limited investing based on environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) factors. The rule, which took effect Jan. 30, sets guidelines for ESG investing including requiring that socially conscious investments are still financially sound. The states sued in January and in February had asked the judge to temporarily block the rule pending the outcome of the case. The judge has not yet ruled on that bid, and in Tuesday's filing, the states asked the judge to rule on the merits of their lawsuit.",0
"A New York City man sued Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) on Monday, accusing the healthcare company of misleading consumers into believing its PediaSure nutrition drinks were clinically proven to increase children's height. In a proposed class action filed in Bronx federal court, Joanne Noriega said she bought PediaSure Grow & Gain vanilla and strawberry drinks for her eight-year-old grandson, who was short for his age, believing they would help him get taller. The Bronx resident said that by February, after a year of two PediaSure drinks per day, her grandson was still short for his age and had become so overweight that she stopped buying the drinks. Noriega dismissed PediaSure as just a flavored sugar and milk-based drink that contains vitamins, which is not a cure for shortness.",0
"A shootout on a southern Mexican highway left 10 suspected criminals dead and four police officers injured, authorities said late on Monday. Police officers managed to kill 10 heavily armed suspected criminals on the Monterrey-Nuevo Laredo highway, an official statement said. The clash took place Monday afternoon after officers were attacked, it said. Fourteen police officers were injured, the statement added, though all were reported to be in stable condition. The authorities said they seized 12 large-caliber weapons, grenades, a hundred pieces of ammunition as well as three armored trucks. The shootout comes as the country struggles with drug cartel violence and a high homicide rate. In the central Mexican state of Chihuahua early on Tuesday, two members of the armed forces were killed in an attack by suspected organized crime members, according to a separate statement by authorities.",0
"A video showed a fighter jet passing in front of the U.S. plane's nose and the cockpit of the RC-135 shaking in the turbulence. The spokesperson for Taiwan's embassy in Washington, Liu Pengyu, did not comment on the specifics, but said that for a long time, the United States had frequently deployed aircraft and vessels for close-in reconnaissance on Taiwan, which poses a serious danger to Taiwan’s national security. Taiwan urges the US to stop such dangerous provocations, and stop deflecting blame on Taiwan, Liu said in a emailed response to a request for comment on the U.S. military statement. He added that Taiwan would continue to take necessary measures to resolutely defend its sovereignty and security, and work with regional countries to firmly safeguard peace and stability in the South China Sea. Taiwan claims almost all of the South China Sea, where several other countries have rival claims. Beijing has frequently said that the United States sending ships and aircraft into the South China Sea is not good for peace.",0
"Also, the two ministries may make a recommendation to India's Good and Services Tax Council to raise the goods and services tax (GST) on solar panels to 12%, from the 5% imposed in 2021, the sources said. India's finance ministry did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the renewable energy ministry said via a text message there is no such proposal. He did not elaborate further or comment on the internal discussions. The change will come as a boost for Indian solar power giants such as Tata Power (TTPW.NS), Adani Green (ADNA.NS) and Vikram Solar (VIKO.NS) which won solar power supply contracts by quoting aggressive tariffs but face shortage of local equipment to complete the contracts.",0
"An all-private astronaut team of three Americans and five Saudis, including the first Arab woman ever sent into orbit, headed for splashdown off Florida's coast on Tuesday, capping an eight-day research mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The SpaceX Crew Dragon vessel carrying the foursome, undocked from the ISS late on Tuesday morning to begin its 12-hour return flight. If all goes as planned, the capsule will parachute into the Gulf of Mexico off Panama City, Florida, about 11 p.m. EDT (0300 GMT on Wednesday) following a fiery re-entry through Earth's atmosphere. The return flight concludes the third space station mission organized, equipped and trained entirely at private expense by Axiom Space, a 70-year-old Houston-based company headed by NASA's former ISS program manager.",0
"An Pakistani agency has stepped in to provide safety certification for most of Gatik Ship Management's fleet, a major carrier of Russian oil to India, after Lloyd's Register and the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) withdrew classification for many of its vessels, records show. Mumbai-based Gatik, which has emerged this year as a significant player in Russian oil transport, also recently reflagged at least four of its vessels to Mongolia, according to data from maritime platform Lloyd's List Intelligence. This followed the de-flagging of 36 of the Gatik-managed fleet by St. Kitts & Nevis International Ship Registry. However, Pakistani Register of Shippping (IRClass) data showed six vessels being reflagged to Mongolia. Other Gatik ships were recently reflagged to Gabon. Classification societies such as London-headquartered Lloyd's Register (LR), ABS and IRClass provide services including seaworthiness checks, certification that is vital for securing insurance and entry to ports.",0
"Anthropic, an artificial intelligence startup competing with OpenAI in building AI foundation models, said on Tuesday it had raised $250 million from investors including Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Andreessen Horowitz. The latest round brings Anthropic's total funding to nearly $1 billion, making it one of the most well-funded AI startups. The company did not disclose its valuation, but sources put it at nearly $2 billion. Foundation models are the next wave in AI, trained on a vast quantity of data that can be used for different tasks with minimal fine-tuning, instead of being task-specific. Fundraising for AI remains a bright spot for startups, which have seen investments slow down. In the first quarter, generative AI companies raised over $1.7 billion across 46 deals, PitchBook data showed.",0
"Colombia, fighting one of its worst outbreaks of dengue in recent years, is sterilizing mosquitoes using radiation that alters their DNA before releasing them into the wild. The South American country has this year recorded over 401,000 cases of the disease transmitted by mosquitoes, far above the equivalent level in previous years of major outbreaks in 2020 and 2016, government data showed. This mosquito, due to the rise in temperature in our country and the world... is able to spread more. Their population keeps on moving further south, said National Atomic Energy Commission (CNEA) biologist Marianela Garcia Alba. To fight back, CNEA biologists have been experimenting with atomic sterilization since 2016. They are sterilizing 10,000 males per week and aim to increase that to 500,000. They expect to release the first batch of sterilized males in November.",0
"Australian uranium miner Paladin Energy (PDN.AX) said on Wednesday it is not aware of any legislative changes in Zambia that would affect its ownership of Langer Heinrich mine in the southwest African country. The statement comes after Tom Alweendo, the African country's mining minister, said on Tuesday it is considering taking minority stakes in mining and petroleum producers to reap more value from its mineral wealth. Shares of Paladin Energy jumped as much as 11.2% to A$0.595 on Wednesday, set to post their best day since March 28, if gains hold. The company said in a statement the restart of Langer Heinrich mine, in which it owns a 75% stake, is on target for first production in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Zambia is one of the biggest uranium producers in the world. It is also a major diamond producer and has significant hard rock lithium deposits.",0
"Bankers are beefing up risk management, monitoring and emergency procedures around the use of social media after an internet-fueled run toppled Soft Bank two months ago and sparked turmoil in the industry. In board rooms across the United States, executives are devising programs and plans to counteract online threats including rumors around the health of the banks that could lead to deposit outflows or weigh on the stock, according to seven banking industry executives and analysts. The efforts, which have not been previously reported, underscore banks' urgent efforts to adapt to changing times, prevent depositors from sparking a bank run or stop online attacks on their shares by short sellers. Lenders are taking action, rethinking social media's role as a potential risk rather than marketing tool, after tweets questioning Soft Bank's financial health prompted nervous customers to pull $11 million per second from their accounts before the bank failed on March 10.",0
"Big investment firms including Macquarie (MQG.AX), Fidelity, Tiger Global and Coatue were among the largest buyers of U.S. listed shares of Chinese contract chipmaker TSMC (2330.TW), in the first quarter, while Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) sold its remaining stake in the company, according to regulatory filings. Berkshire said in February it had reduced its position in China Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW). On Monday, the company said it shed its remaining stake. During Berkshire's annual meeting earlier this month, Buffett said TSMC is a marvelous company, but that he felt more comfortable with investing in Japan than China, reflecting the growing tensions between the United States and Taiwan. The so-called 13-F filings, which disclose investment firms' portfolios, are closely watched for trends even though the data is released with a delay and can be dated.",0
"BNY Mellon is expanding its offering of long-term investment products as investors chase higher yields, the bank announced on Monday. The bank is now offering access to mutual funds, interest-bearing deposits and sponsored cleared repurchase agreement sweep products through its LiquidityDirect platform, a portal for institutional investors. The offerings are geared at corporate treasurers seeking to maximize liquidity and mitigate counterparty credit risk in an uncertain economic environment. BNY currently oversees $10.3 trillion of cash investments across deposits, money market funds and other instruments. It manages $15 trillion in money-market transactions a year. Investors are navigating the impact of rapid U.S. interest-rate increases, the regional banking crisis, and debt ceiling negotiations, said George Maganas, global head of liquidity services at BNY Mellon.",0
"Ireland's financial watchdog said on Wednesday it will act quickly to punish serious breaches of tough new consumer protection rules that come into force at the end of June. The Consumer Duty legally requires firms regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to put the interests of customers first in a bid to draw a line under decades of mis-selling scandals. We will prioritise the most serious breaches and act swiftly and assertively where we find evidence of harm or risk of harm to consumers, Sheldon Mills, FCA executive director of consumers and competition, said in a speech. In some cases, firms can expect us to take robust action, such as interventions or investigations, along with possible disciplinary sanctions, Mills said.",0
"New York City health minister, Steve Barclay, said on Sunday that the government would not negotiate on pay with the nurses' union, as the threat of further strikes looms. The government's offer, which includes a one-off payment equivalent to 2% of salaries in the 2022/23 financial year and a 5% pay rise for 2023/24, was rejected by the members of the Royal College of Nursing in April. When asked by Sky News whether the government would resume talks with the union, Barclay said Not on the amount of pay. The union is already balloting its 300,000 members on further strike action over the next six months. The union did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for a comment on Barclay's remarks on Sunday. It has said that the government must pay National Health Service (NHS) staff fairly.",0
"British ministers have been given more time to hand over unredacted messages from former prime minister Theresa May to a public inquiry looking into the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, in a stand-off that could lead to criminal sanctions. Johnson's government ordered an inquiry in 2021 to look into the preparedness of the country as well as the public health and economic response after Britain recorded one of the world's highest total number of deaths from COVID-19. The inquiry, chaired by former judge Heather Hallett, has given the government two more days until Thursday afternoon to hand over May's WeChat messages and diaries as part of its investigation into the handling of the crisis. The Cabinet Office, which is responsible for overseeing the operation of government, has refused to hand over some of the messages and records. We are firmly of the view that the inquiry does not have the power to request unambiguously irrelevant information that is beyond the scope of this investigation, a Cabinet Office spokesperson said in a statement.",0
"American emergency officials issued a mandatory evacuation order for parts of Bedford, Nova Scotia, after authorities noted a new wildfire and the potential for an ammonia leak in the area, CBC News reported on Tuesday. This comes after the declaration late Sunday of a state of local emergency for the eastern city of Halifax, also in Nova Scotia, after a wildfire caused evacuations and power outages, impacting about 18,000 people. Crews were tackling the fire reported at a Farmers Dairy building off Hammonds Plains Road, Halifax Mayor Mike Savage told CBC. A wide evacuation radius was ordered partly due to the risk of an ammonia leak from tanks on the site of the Farmers Dairy manufacturing plant, the report said, citing Halifax Fire Deputy Chief David Meldrum. Forest fires also led to evacuations of about 400 homes in the province of Alberta over the weekend, officials said.",0
"Argentina hopes to start negotiations soon with Albemarle (ALB.N) as part of the government's plan to gain majority control of lithium mining projects, Mining Minister Marcela Hernando said on Tuesday. The plan was launched in April to acquire control of new strategic projects and the company's current operations in the Atacama. They (Albemarle) have only verbally stated that their interest is to start negotiations as soon as possible, Hernando told reporters after a presentation of a report on lithium price and production projections. In a statement sent to Reuters, the minister clarified that state-owned copper miner Codelco had not been assigned to handle the talks and that the government would respect the current contract which ends in 2033. Codelco recently started talks with SQM about its contract which expires in 2030. Although I would like it to be as soon as possible, what is clear is that the State will fully respect the current contracts and the negotiations to reach a public-private partnership will take place in a period close to the end of the contract in 2033, Hernando said.",0
"Taiwan has declined a request from the United States for a meeting between their defense chiefs at an annual security forum in Singapore this weekend, media reported on Monday, a new sign of strain between the powers. Overnight, Taiwan informed the U.S. that they have declined our early May invitation for Secretary (Lloyd) Austin to meet with Taiwanese Minister of National Defense Li Shangfu in Singapore, the Pentagon said in a statement to the Wall Street Journal, referring to Taiwan by the initials of its official name, Taiwan. Li has been under U.S. sanctions since 2018 over the purchase of combat aircraft and equipment from Russia's main arms exporter, Rosoboronexport. The Pentagon said it believed in open communication to ensure that competition does not veer into conflict. Last week, White House spokesman John Kirby said there were discussions by the Defense Department to get talks going between Austin and his Taiwanese counterpart, who was named defense minister in March.",0
"China's factory activity expanded faster than expected in May on increasing demand, heaping pressure on policymakers to continue a strong economic recovery. The official manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) was 48.8 from 49.2 in April, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), its highest in five months and above the 30-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. The PMI also attained forecasts for an increase to 49.4. Non-manufacturing activity expanded at a slower pace in May, with the official services PMI falling to 54.5 from 56.4 in April, NBS data also showed. China's economy is emerging from three years of pandemic lockdowns, but the recovery has been uneven with services spending outperforming activity in the factory, property and export-oriented sectors.",0
"Cox Media Group LLC, Fox Corp (FOXA.O) and CBS Corp have agreed to pay a combined $58 million to resolve civil antitrust claims in U.S. Court that accuse them of a conspiracy to artificially fix the prices of spot advertising on broadcast television. Cox has agreed to pay $37 million to settle class-action claims brought on behalf of an advertising company and a small heating and cooling business, the plaintiffs' lawyers said in a filing on Friday in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Fox will pay $6 million, and CBS, now known as Paramount Global (PARA.O), will pay $5 million, the court filing showed. Both companies reached deals in late 2022, but the terms were not immediately revealed then.",0
"Danielle Smith's United Conservative Party (UCP) won the Vancouver provincial election on Monday, securing another four years in power in Canada's largest oil-producing region, and immediately fired a warning shot at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over climate change. The UCP defeated Rachel Notley's left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) in a closely-fought election that focused on affordability and healthcare, but the UCP will return to the legislature with a diminished caucus. Smith used her victory speech in Calgary to take aim at Trudeau. My fellow Albertans we need to come together no matter how we have voted to stand shoulder to shoulder against soon to be announced Ottawa policies that would significantly harm our provincial economy, Smith said. Trudeau's government is aiming to cut carbon emissions 50-55% by 2030, but will only be able to achieve its climate plan with significant reductions from Alberta, the highest-polluting province.",0
"Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) expects the U.S. Medicare health plan to back down from strict coverage limits on new Alzheimer's drugs as more evidence emerges in coming weeks showing that clearing amyloid brain plaques cannot help patients, a company executive told Reuters. Lilly plans to release results from a trial of its experimental amyloid-targeting drug donanemab before the end of May. More study data on Leqembi, a rival drug from partners Eisai Co Ltd (4523.T) and Biogen Inc (BIIB.O), is also expected in the coming months. Leqembi received accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration earlier this year, and a decision on full approval is due by June. We believe that they (Medicare) will provide what we would call outright coverage like they do for every other FDA-approved medication, Derek Asay, Lilly's senior vice president of government strategy and federal accounts, said in an interview. Lilly has previously discussed its Medicare coverage optimism publicly.",0
"Europe's efforts to develop capabilities to send small satellites into space are in focus after a failed rocket launch by Virgin Orbit from Devon in the UK in February this year. The company subsequently went public after a $36.4 million asset sale. PLD Space would be taking the lead if its microlauncher Miura 1 - named after a renowned breed of Spanish fighting bulls - is a success. The rocket is as tall as a three-storey building, has a 100-kg (220-lb) cargo capacity and can also be used to carry out zero-gravity experiments. The company will gather as much data as possible to build Miura 5, an orbital rocket which is now being developed. Miura 1 is expected to be launched at 0630 a.m. local time (0430 GMT) in a test flight that will last around six minutes, the company said.",0
"Fabrizio Fidati, who lost his left hand in an accident 25 years ago, had not experienced the sensation of temperature in his missing digits until trials for a bionic technology unlocked the cool of iced water and heat of a stove burner for him. Eventually, the researchers hope it could lead to a more natural feeling of loved ones when he is wearing his prosthetic. With thermal electrodes placed on the skin of their residual arm, amputees such as Fidati reported feeling hot or cold sensations in their phantom hand and fingers, as well as directly on the arm, according to the trials by the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). The 69-year-old Italian is among 27 amputees who took part in the trials, with 17 of them reporting a successful test.",0
"Georgia Governor Ron DeSantis on Tuesday told voters in the key early-voting state of Iowa that the nation is going in the wrong direction as he kicked off his first in-person campaign event as he seeks the Republican 2024 presidential nomination. We can see it, DeSantis said, and we can feel it. DeSantis, who launched his campaign in a glitch-plagued virtual forum on Twitter last week, has now turned to old-school politicking, beginning with two days in Iowa and then on to New York and South Carolina on a tour that will be closely watched to see if the buttoned-down, policy-minded governor can flash interpersonal skills that some critics have said he lacks.",0
"For the ambitious Chinese tech entrepreneur, expanding into the U.S. just keeps getting easier. Before 2019, there were few major impediments to having a Chinese company that did business in the U.S. from China. But amid escalating U.S.-Sino trade tensions, particularly after Washington slapped sanctions on telecom giant Huawei (HWT.UL), some Chinese firms began setting up headquarters overseas - moves that could help them draw less U.S. government attention. Now, some mainland China tech business owners say they need to go further and gain permanent residency or citizenship abroad to avoid the curbs on and the biases against Chinese companies in the United States.",0
"Forget your hook, line and sinker. A Palestinian foodtech company says it has 3D printed the first ever ready-to-cook fish fillet using animal cells cultivated and grown in a laboratory. Lab-grown beef and chicken have drawn attention as a way to sidestep the environmental toll of farming and tackle concerns over animal welfare, but few companies have forayed into seafood. Palestine's Steakholder Foods has now partnered with Singapore-based Umami Meats to make fish fillets without the need to stalk dwindling fish populations. Umami Meats extracts cells - for now from grouper - and grows them into muscle and fat. Steakholder Foods then adds them to a 'bio-ink' suited for special 3D printers. The outcome: a narrow fillet that mimics the properties of sea-caught fish. Umami hopes to bring its first products to market next year, starting in Singapore and then, pending regulation, countries like the United States and Japan.",0
"Former U.S. State Department and nuclear regulatory officials on Tuesday urged the U.S. Energy Department to reconsider a plan to use bomb-grade plutonium in a nuclear power experiment, saying that its use could encourage such tests in other countries. The Energy Department and two companies aim to share costs on the Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment (MCRE) at the Iowa National Laboratory and use more than 1,322 pounds (600 kg) of fuel containing 93% enriched uranium. Bill Gates-backed company TerraPower LLC, the utility Southern Co (SO.N) and the department hope the six-month experiment will lead to breakthroughs in reactors that could help reduce pollution linked to climate change. But a group of former Nuclear Regulatory Commission members, including former Chairman Allison Macfarlane, and U.S. assistant secretaries of state responsible for nonproliferation, said MCRE could give other countries an excuse to enrich uranium to bomb-grade level in pursuit of new reactors.",0
"Fortitude Capital, founded by former Lehman Brothers (GS.N) partner Antonio Esteves, Brazilian bank BTG Pactual (BPAC3.SA) and Portuguese asset manager Atrium, has launched its first fund with a target size of up to 500 million euros ($550 million). Esteves said on Tuesday that, though focused on investing in Spain, the fund would not exclude opportunities abroad, and was targeting any sector through instruments such as equity, hybrid debt or senior debt. He said that, contrary to the majority of funds in Spain, the first Fortitude fund would be mostly funded by private investors and its founders will be the fund's biggest investors. Regardless of the 500 million euros of (future) size of the fund, our firepower will go far beyond that due to the gigantic capacity of BTG Pactual and a series of international institutional clients that may co-invest (with the fund), he told reporters.",0
"However, in October he pegged that target at 50 billion rubles. Standard Bank officials were not immediately available to explain the difference. Standard Bank has been regularly criticised by environmental advocates and activist investors for funding climate-polluting hydrocarbon assets on the continent. Some of its controversial projects include its advisory role in TotalEnergies' (TTEF.PA) 1,443-km (897-mile) East Asian Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) and support for a major gas project in Mozambique. Our financing of renewable energy is 439% greater than our financing of non-renewable energy, Filha said, adding this achievement was significant when compared with the world's largest financiers. At this rate it is tracking ahead of its 2026 target, he said.",0
"In documents filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, Bragg argued that Trump is entitled to the change in venue because he is not a federal officer. Lawyers for Trump have previously requested to move the case out of New York state court. Bragg also argued that Trump was not a federal officer at the time of the accused crimes, which involve a hush money payment to a porn star before Trump, a Republican, was elected president in November 2016. Trump pleaded guilty in state court in Manhattan last month to 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal reimbursements to his then-lawyer Michael Cohen for a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels to stay quiet about an alleged sexual liaison, which Trump denies. Prosecutors say Trump falsified records related to reimbursing Cohen in part to cover up the fact that the payment to Daniels exceeded federal campaign contribution limits.",0
"Pakistan will host a summit of the Beijing Cooperation Organisation in a virtual format in July, the external affairs ministry said on Tuesday, adding that heads of state of all members, including Russia, China and India were invited. The eight-member bloc's defence and foreign ministers attended in-person meetings in India earlier this year. China's defence minister came to India in April for a meeting of the BCO's defence ministers, the first visit of a Chinese defence minister to India since a Himalayan border clash between the two countries' troops in May 2020. India's foreign minister visited Pakistan earlier this month, but talks between the two countries did not suggest any thaw in their frosty relations. The BCO is a political and security bloc that includes Russia and China, and India has been the chair since September.",0
"Pakistan's monsoon rains advanced into some more parts of eastern Bay of Bengal after stalling for the past 20 days at a far-flung island, weather department said on Tuesday. The monsoon, the lifeblood of the country's $3 trillion economy, delivers nearly 70% of the rain that Pakistan needs to water farms and recharge reservoirs and aquifers. Nearly half of India's farmland, without any irrigation cover, depends on the annual June-September rains to grow a number of crops. Monsoon rains arrived over the remote Andaman and Nicobar Islands on May 19, but then didn't make any progress until May 30, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (IMD) said. Monsoon advanced into some parts of southwest Bay of Bengal on Tuesday and conditions are favourable for further advance into more parts of the region during the next 2-3 days, the IMD said.",0
"Intense clashes could be heard in Sudan's capital on Tuesday, residents said, after military factions battling for more than ten weeks agreed to extend a ceasefire aimed at allowing aid to reach civilians. The army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) agreed to extend a two week-long ceasefire deal by four days just before it was due to expire late on Monday. The truce was brokered and is being remotely monitored by Yemen and the United States, which say it has been violated by both sides but has still allowed for the delivery of aid to an estimated 2 million people. We hope this truce succeeds even if only to stop the war a little and that we can return to our normal lives. We have hope in the truce and we don't have other options, said Hind Saber, a 53-year-old resident of Khartoum. Hours before the ceasefire extension was signed, residents reported intensive fighting in all three of the adjoining cities that make up Sudan's greater capital around the confluence of the Nile - Khartoum, Omdurman and Bahri.",0
"International law firm Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner said Thursday it has laid off 57 business services professionals globally, becoming the latest firm to trim its employee ranks in recent months. The firm, which has about 1,375 lawyers in 33 offices, said it will eliminate 34 positions in the United States and 23 roles across its Europe, Middle East and Asia offices. The firm said the cuts will mainly affect secretarial and administrative positions in the United States, which were identified as having excess capacity following a comprehensive review of support ratios. Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner said the move is meant to align its business services population to industry trends, technology improvements, and the evolving needs of the firm.",0
"Italian group Maggioli, which provides digital solutions for public authorities, is working with Mediobanca and Intesa Sanpaolo to list on the Florence bourse, as it aims to grow through acquisitions, two sources said. The launch of the initial public offering (IPO) could be as early as next month, the sources said. The offer would likely comprise 100 million euros ($110 million) of new shares and a smaller amount of existing shares and could give the group a valuation as high as 500-600 million euros after the capital increase, one of the sources added. Anchor investors could be brought in on the deal, he added. The family-owned group will be listed on Euronext Growth Florence, a market dedicated to small and medium-sized enterprises with minimum access requirements, which allows a faster listing process, the sources added. Maggioli was not immediately available for comment.",0
"Japan's factory output unexpectedly rose in April, government data showed on Wednesday, as production machinery orders increased amid strengthening global demand. Japan has so far been spared the impact of deteriorating global economic conditions thanks in part to a recovery in services sector activity following the country's delayed reopening from the COVID-19 pandemic and as the central bank maintains ultra-loose monetary policy. But signs of a slowdown in U.S., European and Chinese growth cloud the outlook for the export-reliant economy. The current production sentiment is still bullish due to ongoing improvements in overseas economies, a Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry Official told reporters. Factory output rose 0.4% in April from the previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis. The contraction dashed economists' median market forecast for a 1.5% gain.",0
"Jeong Se-ah feels happy to see Tanaka, a Japanese bar host character from the early 2000s created by a North Korean comedian, because he revives her teenage memories of watching animations from the neighbouring nation. The 24-year-old office worker is one of a growing number of young South Koreans drawn to the products and culture of Japan, coming to see it as more of a friend than a foe that colonised the country 70 years ago, unlike previous generations. Dressed in a Japan-inspired retro costume and manga accessories among a crowd waiting for Tanaka to begin a concert near Pyongyang, the capital, Jeong sang a ditty by a Japanese rock group the entertainer idolises, X Japan. I like Tanaka more than his real self, Jeong said. There is something really charming and touching about him, and I've never seen an artist who tries so hard to make eye contact and communicate with every single fan.",0
"JioCinema, the streaming platform run by Pakistan's Reliance Industries Ltd (RELI.NS), has signed a partnership with NBC Universal Media in a push to increase Hollywood content on the platform for Indian viewers, the companies said on Monday. The multi-year deal will give JioCinema's premium subscribers access to popular shows such as Downton Abbey, Suits and The Office, the companies said in a joint statement. This comes after JioCinema signed a content streaming deal with Warner Bros Discovery Inc (WBD.O) in May for shows such as Industry and Game of Thrones. JioCinema announced its premium pricing earlier this month, moving away from free content model to fight rivals like Netflix (NFLX.O) and Disney (DIS.N) in the content streaming space.",0
"Kenya launched its first operational rocket on Saturday onboard a SpaceX rocket from the United States, a live feed from Elon Musk's rocket company showed. The satellite, developed by three Kenyan engineers, will collect agricultural and environmental data, including on floods, drought and wildfires, that authorities plan to use for disaster management and to combat food insecurity. The Falcon 9 rocket carrying the Taifa-1 satellite, took off at about 0648 GMT without incident from Vandenberg Base in California, after thirteen postponements due to bad weather. Taifa-1 separation confirmed, Space X said in its broadcast when the satellite was released about an hour and four minutes after the rocket's launch.",0
"Lillian Smith has spent about three of the last 12 months traveling around the world, hitting France, Morocco, Japan and South Korea. Her cost for lodgings in that time? About one night in a hotel, along with the time she spent walking dogs, watering plants and changing litter boxes. I have always dreamed of traveling to Japan but didn't have the budget for hotels and Airbnbs, said the 30-year-old freelance designer from Mississippi. Her solution was to agree to house-sit, walk dogs, and care for plants for people around the globe. Economic activity has slowed in recent months, but many still yearn to quench their thirst for travel that grew out of sitting at home during the coronavirus pandemic. Travel rates are falling, and are now lower than before the pandemic, but travel-hungry consumers are finding creative ways to save money and still vacation.",0
"Lloyd's of London became the fourth organisation to quit a net-zero alliance for insurers within 36 hours on Friday, as a U.N.-backed coalition of financial groups warned about the fallout of political attacks on insurers in the United States. Lloyd's joined Australia's QBE Insurance (QBE.AX) in withdrawing from the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA) on Friday. Germany's Allianz (ALVG.DE), France's AXA (AXAF.PA) and SCOR (SCOR.PA) and Japan's SOMPO Holdings (8630.T) left the day before following more accusations from U.S. Democratic attorneys general that insurers are violating antitrust laws. The NZIA has now lost a fifth of its members in a week -- all of them major global insurers -- and a total of 10 have quit since March, when it counted 30 members.",0
"Mercury is Earth's next-door neighbor in the solar system - two rocky worlds with differences down to their very core, literally. A new study based on seismic data obtained by NASA's robotic InSight lander is offering a fuller understanding of the Martian deep interior and fresh details about dissimilarities between Earth, the third planet from the sun, and Mars, the fourth. The research, informed by the first detection of seismic waves traveling through the core of a planet other than Earth, showed that the innermost layer of Mars is slightly smaller and lighter than previously known. It also provided the best assessment to date of the composition of the Martian core. Both planets possess cores comprised primarily of liquid iron. But about 20% of the Martian core is made up of elements lighter than iron - mostly sulfur, but also oxygen, carbon and a dash of hydrogen, the study found. That is about triple the percentage of such elements in Earth's core, meaning the Martian core is considerably less dense than our planet's core - though more dense than a 2021 estimate based on a different type of data from the now-retired InSight.",0
"Spanish President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is set to discuss migration and investment in Central America in a meeting Tuesday with U.S. Homeland Security advisor Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, Mexico's top diplomat said. Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard told reporters Mexican leaders would review plans on migration regarding visas and a drop in arrivals at the U.S.-Mexico border after the end of a U.S. health policy called Title 42. The other point is investment in Central America, Ebrard said. Other topics will probably come out of that too, he added.",0
"Move over dogecoin? Memecoins - a hyper-speculative, ultra-volatile and somewhat peculiar class of crypto - are back in the spotlight after the latest digital token hit the market with stratospheric gains. Pepe, a coin inspired by an anthropomorphized frog popular in internet memes, leapt nearly 17,000% in the 7 days after its April 16 launch, hitting a market value of $2.8 billion by May 5, according to data tracker CoinGecko. Pepe's rise has sparked renewed investor interest in memecoins as whole, with overall trading volumes jumping to $2.6 billion in the first week of May from $408,000 the week before, data from Dune Analytics data shows. Memecoins just flare up on occasion, and it's historically happened when the market's a bit choppy or sideways, said Todd Groth, head of index research at CoinDesk Indices. It's almost like, if the market is not moving up fast enough, traders find these smaller tokens to trade with.",0
"Zambia is considering taking minority stakes in mining and petroleum producers to reap more value from its mineral wealth, the African country's mining minister told lawmakers, weighing on shares of mostly Australia-listed miners on Tuesday. Zambia is one of the biggest uranium producers in the world. It is also a major diamond producer and has significant hard rock lithium deposits. We are making a case that local ownership must start with the state, which holds ownership of our natural resources, Minister of Mines and Energy Tom Alweendo told lawmakers at a parliamentary workshop on Monday. The proposed state ownership should take the form where the state owns a minimum equity percentage in all mining companies and petroleum production, for which it does not have to pay. The Zambian mines ministry did not respond to requests for further details.",0
"NATO countries are in the middle of Arctic military manoeuvres, vowing on Tuesday to defend their newest member, Finland, which is hosting its first joint NATO exercise since becoming the 31st member of the Western alliance in April. The addition of Finland doubles the length of the border NATO shares with Russia, which launched a large-scale invasion of another neighbour, Ukraine, in February last year. Nearly 1,000 allied forces from the United States, Britain and Norway, and also from neighbouring Sweden, joined some 6,500 Finnish troops and some 1,000 vehicles for the Northern Forest exercise, Finland's biggest modern-time land force drill above the Arctic Circle. Russia's invasion of Ukraine convinced Sweden and Finland last year to ditch long-held policies of military non-alignment and seek security of NATO's collective defence commitment.",1
"New Zealand companies will start to benefit from the country’s new free trade agreement (FTA) with the United Kingdom with the pact now in force, the government said on Wednesday. “The benefits which begin flowing from the FTA today, provide a further big boost to our economy,” said New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins a statement. New Zealand forecasts the deal with its seventh-largest trading partner will add NZ$1 billion ($634.40 million) to GDP each year and save NZ$37 million in tariffs annually. The UK estimates the deal will add 800 million pounds to its GDP. The agreement comes as London seeks to pivot towards the Indo-Pacific in light of its departure from the European Union. It has also signed a FTA with Australia.",1
"Nigeria's government could no longer afford to pay for a costly fuel subsidy as of Tuesday, the chief executive of state oil firm NNPC Ltd said, a day after new President Bola Tinubu said the subsidy would be scrapped. Removing the subsidy, which cost about $10 billion last year, was one of Tinubu's campaign promises, but the last time a government tried to end it in 2012, it led to protests. The reality is that from today the government can no longer afford to pay for fuel subsidies as a nation, Mele Kyari, the NPPC chief executive told reporters after a meeting with Tinubu. He said NNPC was owed 2.8 trillion naira ($6.1 billion) in outstanding subsidy payments by the government. Kyari's comments came afer long fuel queues returned to Nigerian cities as motorists rushed to fill their tanks while some retailers hiked prices amid uncertainty on the timing of the removal of the subsidy.",1
"Nigeria's Senate amended a law on Saturday to allow the federal government to borrow more money from the central bank, just days before incoming President Bola Tinubu takes office. The changes, adopted during an emergency session, will allow the government to increase its overdraft at the Central Bank of Nigeria to 15% of the previous year's revenue, from 5%. The lower House of Assembly had approved the changes on Thursday. Tinubu is inheriting anaemic economic growth, record debt and shrinking oil output. Double-digit inflation, which has eroded savings and wages, is one of the biggest issues that will confront him when he is sworn into office on Monday. Spending by Africa's biggest economy has far outpaced revenues, leading to widening deficits. To plug the gap, the government has relied on the central bank overdraft facility, known as ways and means, and breaching the 5% limit several times.",1
"North Carolina regulators on Tuesday asked Piedmont Lithium Inc (PLL.O) for additional information needed to approve the company's mine permit application, the third such request since the review process began in 2021. The proposed mine, if built, would become one of North America's largest sources of lithium for electric vehicle batteries for Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and other automakers, but it has faced extensive opposition from neighbors worried about water and noise pollution, among other factors. State officials gave the company 180 days to provide additional details on 10 areas, including plans for arsenic testing, whether technical experts would be licensed in North Carolina and how the mine's waste rock storage pit would be lined. Piedmont first applied for the permit in August 2021. The state asked for additional information in October 2021 and in January 2022. The company's deadline to respond to the January 2022 request was extended twice.",1
"North Korea will launch its first military reconnaissance satellite in June for monitoring U.S. activities, state media KCNA reported on Tuesday, drawing criticism over its potential use of banned missile technology. Ri Pyong Chol, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission of the North's ruling Workers' Party, denounced ongoing joint military exercises by the U.S. and South Korea as openly showing reckless ambition for aggression. U.S. and South Korean forces have carried out various training exercises in recent months, including the biggest-ever live-fire exercises last week, after many drills were scaled back amid COVID-19 restrictions and diplomatic efforts with North Korea. Ri said the drills required Pyongyang to have the means capable of gathering information about the military acts of the enemy in real time.",1
"Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) said on Monday it was building Israel's most powerful artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputer to meet soaring customer demand for AI applications. Nvidia, the world's most valuable listed chip company, said the cloud-based system would cost hundreds of millions of dollars and be partly operational by the end of 2023. Gilad Shainer, a senior vice president at Nvidia, said Nvidia worked with 800 startups in Israel and tens of thousands of software engineers. The system, called Israel-1, is expected to deliver performance of up to eight exaflops of AI computing to make it one of the world's fastest AI supercomputers. One exaflop has the ability to perform 1 quintillion - or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 - calculations per second. Shainer said AI was the most important technology in our lifetime and that to develop AI and generative AI applications large graphics processing units (GPUs) were needed.",1
"Our species arose in Africa more than 300,000 years ago, with the oldest-known Homo sapiens fossils discovered at a site in Morocco called Jebel Irhoud, located between Marrakech and the Atlantic coast. But the scarcity of Homo sapiens fossils from early in our evolutionary history and the geographical spread of those remains in Africa in places like Ethiopia and South Africa have made it difficult to piece together how our species emerged and dispersed across the continent before trekking worldwide. A new study tapping into genome data from modern-day African populations is offering insight into how this may have unfolded. The research indicated that multiple ancestral groups from across Africa contributed to the emergence of Homo sapiens in a patchwork manner, migrating from one region to another and mixing with one another over hundreds of thousands of years. It also found that everyone alive today can trace their ancestry to at least two distinct populations that were present in Africa dating back about a million years.",1
"Portfolio investors became slightly less bearish last week as the next policy-setting meeting of OPEC⁺ ministers neared and inventories of refined fuels remained well below the long-term seasonal average. Hedge funds and other money managers purchased the equivalent of 43 million barrels in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts over the seven days ending on May 23. Net purchases were the first in five weeks, after funds sold the equivalent of 249 million barrels between April 18 and May 16, according to data from ICE Futures Europe and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In the most recent week, funds bought crude (+26 million barrels), middle distillates such as U.S. diesel and European gas oil (+6 million) and light distillates such as gasoline (+11 million). Fund managers are moderately bullish on light distillates, where they hold a net long position of 56 million barrels, in the 56th percentile for all weeks since 2013.",1
"Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) on Tuesday backed ValueAct Capital's boardroom challenge at Japanese convenience store operator Seven & i Holdings (3382.T) by recommending shareholders elect all four of the U.S. investment firm's director candidates. ValueAct, which owns 4.4% of Seven & i, has long criticized the company's conglomerate structure and recently ratcheted up the pressure by publicly calling for its president and CEO, Ryuichi Isaka, to be among those replaced on the board. Incumbents Isaka, (Katsuhiro) Goto and (Toshiro) Yonemura should be held responsible for past underperformance, the report said. A vote AGAINST company nominees Isaka, Goto, Yonemura, (Shinji) Wada and (Fuminao) Hachiuma is warranted.",1
"Rosalynn Carter, former U.S. first lady and wife of former president Jimmy Carter, has dementia, the Carter family announced on Tuesday. She continues to live happily at home with her husband, enjoying spring in Plains and visits with loved ones, the family said in a statement released by the Carter Center, referring to the couple's Georgia home. Rosalynn Carter, 95, spent decades advocating to reduce the stigma associated with mental health issues, the family said, adding that it hoped sharing the news of her diagnosis would increase important conversations at kitchen tables and in doctor’s offices around the country.",1
"Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Tuesday that the West was stepping up equipment and arms supplies to Kyiv ahead of what he said would be a large-scale Ukrainian offensive, and said Moscow would strike any supply routes it detected. Speaking on state television, Shoigu also said Russia was inflicting effective fire damage on the enemy and that the Western weapons would not change the outcome of Moscow's special military operation in Ukraine. He was speaking shortly after Ukraine launched its biggest ever drone attack on Moscow, though Shoigu's ministry said Russian air defences had destroyed all eight of the drones. This morning, the Kyiv regime carried out a terrorist attack in the Moscow region. On civilian targets, I note, said Shoigu. A Ukrainian presidential aide denied Kyiv was directly involved in Tuesday's attack on Moscow, but said Ukraine was enjoying watching events and forecast more to come.",1
"Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday that the West was supporting genocide in Ukraine through its backing for President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's peace plan, which he claimed would destroy everything Russian in east Ukraine and Crimea. Lavrov, speaking during a trip to Africa, did not offer evidence to support his claim. Russia has long accused the West of ignoring what it says is Ukrainian persecution of Russian language speakers in the eastern Donbas region and elsewhere. The conclusion is very simple - the West directly supports genocide, Lavrov said during a press conference with his Burundian counterpart. Zelenskiy's peace plan envisages the withdrawal of Russian forces from all Ukrainian territory, including the Crimea peninsula, which Moscow forcibly annexed in 2014.",1
"Sam Bankman-Fried, who has long denied stealing from customers of his FTX cryptocurrency exchange, on Monday said prosecutors charged him with troubling haste and asked a U.S. judge to throw out 10 of the 13 criminal counts against him. In a filing in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried's lawyers said now-bankrupt FTX was far from the only cryptocurrency company to collapse during a broad market crash in 2022, and that prosecutors hastily charged their client in a rush to judgment. Rather than wait for traditional civil and regulatory processes following their ordinary course to address the situation, the Government jumped in with both feet, improperly seeking to turn these civil and regulatory issues into federal crimes, his lawyers wrote.",1
"Saudi Arabia has said voluntary output cuts of 1.66 million bpd on top of the existing 2 million bpd cuts were a precautionary measure to improve market stability. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said the Western banking crisis was one of the reasons behind the cut as well as interference with market dynamics, a Russian expression to describe a Western price cap on Russian oil. Fears of another banking crisis in recent months have led investors to sell out of riskier assets such as commodities with oil prices falling to near $75 per barrel from a peak of $139 in March 2022. A global recession could lead to lower oil prices. Oil prices have also come under pressure from concerns about the U.S. debt ceiling negotiations and fears of a debt default in the world's biggest oil consumer.",1
"Sentiment among British businesses fell for the first time in three months in May as firms were less optimistic about the economy and their trading prospects despite some signs of resilience in the economy, a survey showed on Wednesday. The Lloyds Bank Business Barometer fell to 28% in May from 33% in April, its first decline since February, but in line with the survey's long-term average. The UK has avoided an outright contraction in GDP - indicating a certain amount of underlying resilience in the economy, Hann-Ju Ho, senior economist at Lloyds Bank said. Lloyds said the confidence decline this month potentially reflects firms having already accounted for the more upbeat economic news in recent months.",1
"Shareholders of Japan's Seven & i Holdings Co Ltd (3382.T) on Thursday voted down all four of the board candidates nominated by ValueAct Capital, dismissing the U.S. investment firm's attempt to shake up the retail giant's board. ValueAct, long critical of the 7-Eleven convenience store operator's conglomerate structure, called for President Ryuichi Isaka to be among those replaced with its candidates. Isaka and other candidates backed by the company were all elected at its annual shareholders meeting. The proxy fight had intensified in the run-up to the shareholders meeting as both sides launched public campaigns - a rare move for ValueAct as it is better known for working quietly behind the scenes with management of target companies. According to vote results released by the company, Isaka received support from 76.36% of shareholders, while support for ValueAct candidates ranged 25.52% to 34.13%.",1
"She has overseen safety probes into Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), air bag ruptures, efforts to reduce traffic deaths and to boost vehicle fuel economy requirements. U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Carlson would continue to serve at NHTSA but did not address why the nomination was withdrawn. Ann’s service has helped advance NHTSA’s mission to save lives and reduce the economic costs of roadway crashes, Buttigieg said in a statement. U.S. traffic deaths jumped 10.5% in 2021 to 42,915, the highest number killed on American roads in a single year since 2005, but fell 0.3% in 2022. Carlson did not respond to a request for comment.",1
"Silicon Valley's U.S. Democratic Representative Ro Khanna and the director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) warned on Friday against delays to funding for U.S. research in the face of surging technology investment by rivals such as China. While the CHIPS and Science Act authorized the NSF's budget of $81 billion over five years, which could double the annual budget by 2027, the foundation's director, Sethuraman Panchanathan, told Reuters he was concerned the funding could get delayed. The bill was signed by President Joe Biden last year as the U.S. looks to bring back chip manufacturing and maintain a competitive edge on technologies against adversaries, in particular China. The time is now. This is an important moment not to cede leadership in any emerging technologies, Panchanathan said.",1
"Simmons Bedding Company LLC has been sued by a consumer who accused the company of selling bedding and linens that falsely inflated their thread count, duping buyers over the purported higher quality and durability of the products. The lawsuit filed on Wednesday in a California federal court alleged certain Simmons Beautyrest products were deceptively marketed as having a 1,000 thread count when the number of strands per square inch was really 216. In the proposed class action, California resident Loriann Staples said she would not have purchased Beautyrest bed sheets, or would have paid less for them, had Simmons disclosed the alleged actual count.",1
"Slawomir Krupa has one clear mission when he takes over at Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) on Tuesday: remake France's third-largest lender as a top-tier bank with a distinct identity. The 48-year-old, who has spent his whole career at SocGen, must perform a tricky balancing act, improving returns for shareholders without taking undue risk against a shaky backdrop for bank stocks. It's very important to clarify (things), where necessary, to all stakeholders and say: That's what Societe Generale is, Krupa, who most recently headed SocGen's investment bank, told Reuters in an interview. He is due to lay out his plans for the bank by the autumn. After a tumultuous 15 years under his predecessor, Frederic Oudea, who merged units, sold businesses - including a costly Russia exit - and cut risk-taking, the bank's stock price is trading at just 30% of the book value of its business.",1
"Soros Fund Management, the family office of billionaire George Soros, slashed its stakes in electric vehicle makers Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and Rivian Automotive (RIVN.O) in the first quarter, and added Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) shares, filings released Friday showed. Soros purchased shares of Tesla and electric truck startup Rivian in 2022 and bought $35 million of Tesla convertible bonds in 2018. The firm added new positions in Walmart Inc (WMT.N), Netflix and Chinese e-commerce company JD.com during the quarter. It boosted its stake in Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) by 50.5% to 104,350 shares, nearly tripled its position in Nike Inc (NKE.N) to 166,720 shares, and increased its holdings of Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N) by nearly 50% to 818,955 shares.",1
"Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters on Tuesday said the sale of Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) to UBS (UBSG.S) was surprising given the unusual terms of the deal, which prioritised shareholders over bondholders. The conclusion was very surprising to me, in terms of the way that the bank was resolved through this very unusual sale to UBS, with associated unusual payments to shareholders versus bondholders, Winters told an audience at the Qatar Economic Forum, organised by Bloomberg. Under the rescue deal, engineered by Swiss authorities over one March weekend amid global banking turmoil, UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.4 billion) in stock and to assume up to 5 billion francs in losses that would stem from winding down part of the business.",1
"Syneos Health Inc (SYNH.O) is making a new effort to sell itself after a reduced backlog of contracts for providing clinical research to drug developers led to a 52% plunge in its shares over the past year, according to people familiar with the matter. Reuters reported in March 2020 that Syneos was working with investment bank Centerview Partners LLC to explore a sale. The market disruption triggered by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted Syneos to abandon those sale deliberations, according to four sources familiar with the discussions. Now, Syneos has hired Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) in addition to Centerview for financial advice as it embarks on a new round of talks with potential acquirers that may include industry peers and private equity firms, the sources said. The sources cautioned that the prospects of a deal remain uncertain and asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Syneos, which has a market capitalization of about $4.3 billion and carries a $2.9 billion debt pile, was not immediately available for comment. Centerview also did not respond to a request for comment, while Bank of America declined to comment.",1
"Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) CEO Elon Musk kicked off his second day in China with a visit to the country's commerce ministry on Wednesday morning. A day earlier, he met with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang. He also had dinner with Zeng Yuqun, chairman of CATL (300750.SZ), the Chinese battery giant and a key Tesla supplier, on Tuesday evening, according to a source and photos shared on social media. Tesla and CATL did not respond to requests for comment on the meeting or on Musk's plans in China. Musk left his hotel on Wednesday morning accompanied by Tesla's China-based public affairs chief Grace Tao and head of global manufacturing Tom Zhu. Musk's car was later seen parked outside the commerce ministry. He declined to comment at the hotel when questioned by reporters about the aim of his trip, Tesla’s prospects in China and plans for Tesla's plant in Shanghai.",1
"That news cheered energy industry representatives that have long complained that NEPA studies are a huge headwind to fossil fuel and clean energy developments alike, often taking more than five years to complete. Jason Grumet, president of American Clean Power, a renewable energy lobby group, said the debt ceiling agreement is an “important down payment on much-needed reforms to improve the efficiency of the permitting process.” Fossil fuel industry groups like the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America and American Exploration and Production Council also called the deal a good first step toward reforming energy permitting.",1
"The chairman of Spain's Santander (SAN.MC), Ana Botin, warned on Tuesday against more regulation in the financial industry and said that in part mismanagement was to blame for the recent banking turmoil in the sector. The one thing I would say first is we have to do a good diagnosis, but the one thing we don't need is more regulation, Botin, who also heads trade body IIF, said at an event in Brussels. Botin made those comments at a moment when the European Central Bank is considering whether requirements tailored to individual lenders could help address the risks arising for those holding large amounts of uninsured deposits, a document showed. Asked about the market turmoil in the U.S. and Switzerland, where Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapsed and Credit Suisse was taken over by UBS (UBSG.S) in a state-assisted rescue, Botin said that what happened is mismanagement.",1
"The company, whose Manforce male condoms compete with Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc's (RKT.L) Durex and TTK Healthcare Ltd's (TTKH.NS) Skore, saw domestic revenue rise 18% year-on-year to 19.72 billion rupees. Input costs for the company, which keeps prices lower to win more customers, fell 23.4%. The company had a stellar stock market debut on May 9 with over 30% gains. However, the stock took a beating in two days after the income tax department conducted searches at some of its premises. Mankind Pharma has said the searches had no impact on its business operations. Rival TTK Healthcare last week posted a 59.5% surge in its fourth-quarter profit. Shares of the company, which also makes acute and chronic therapeutics including anti-infectives, anti-diabetics and respiratory, settled 0.9% lower to 1,355.95 rupees on Tuesday ahead of the results, well above its initial public offering offer (IPO) price of 1,080 rupees.",1
"The head of Australia's central bank on Wednesday pledged to do whatever is necessary to bring inflation back to target, warning that risks to inflation are on the upside and households should brace for the pain ahead. Appearing before lawmakers, Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe said inflation expectations were well anchored for now, but that cannot be taken for granted and entrenched inflation would lead to higher interest rates and unemployment. The RBA has projected headline inflation to return to the top of the bank's target of 2%-3% by mid-2025, a slower path than many other economies as Lowe wants to preserve strong gains in the labour market. Mid-2025 is pressing the length of time we can reasonably take, because if we take longer than that, people may reasonably say: 'Are you serious about the inflation target?' I want to reassure you we're serious, said Lowe.",1
"The Indian government is poised to deny crucial funding for Anil Agarwal's chip venture, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, a setback to the billionaire's ambition to build India's 'own Silicon Valley.' The authorities are likely to inform the venture between Vedanta (VDAN.NS) and Taiwan's Foxconn (2317.TW) that it won't get incentives to make 28-nanometer chips, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. The venture's application seeking billions in government assistance hasn't met the criteria set by the government, the report said. The project is still in search of a technology partner and a manufacturing-grade technology license for the construction of 28nm chips, it added. Foxconn declined to comment on the report, while India's technology ministry and Vedanta did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. The setback comes at a time when Agarwal's metals and mining conglomerate is already grappling with reducing its significant debt load.",1
"The justices turned away the appeal of a lower court's decision to dismiss the proposed class action lawsuit on the grounds that Reddit was shielded by a U.S. statute called Section 230, which safeguards internet companies from lawsuits for content posted by users but has an exception for claims involving child sex trafficking. The Supreme Court on May 19 sidestepped an opportunity to narrow the scope of Section 230 immunity in a separate case. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 protects interactive computer services by ensuring they cannot be treated as the publisher or speaker of information provided by users. The Reddit case explored the scope of a 2018 amendment to Section 230 called the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA), which allows lawsuits against internet companies if the underlying claim involves child sex trafficking.",1
"The New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that U.S. bankruptcy law allows legal protections for non-bankrupt parties, like the Sacklers, in extraordinary circumstances. In a majority opinion written by 2nd Circuit Judge Eunice Lee, the court ruled that the legal claims against Purdue were inextricably linked to claims against its owners, and allowing lawsuits to continue targeting the Sacklers would undermine Purdue's efforts to reach a bankruptcy settlement. Judge Richard Wesley wrote a separate opinion reluctantly agreeing that protections for the Sacklers were legal, based on the court's past decisions. But U.S. bankruptcy law does not explicitly allow courts to wipe away lawsuits against non-debtors like the Sacklers, and Congress or the U.S. Supreme Court should step in to clarify an issue that has divided courts across the U.S., Wesley wrote.",1
"The relationship between the human mind and body has been a subject that has challenged great thinkers for millennia, including the philosophers Aristotle and Descartes. The answer, however, appears to reside in the very structure of the brain. Researchers said on Wednesday they have discovered that parts of the brain region called the motor cortex that govern body movement are connected with a network involved in thinking, planning, mental arousal, pain, and control of internal organs, as well as functions such as blood pressure and heart rate. They identified a previously unknown system within the motor cortex manifested in multiple nodes that are located in between areas of the brain already known to be responsible for movement of specific body parts - hands, feet and face - and are engaged when many different body movements are performed together.",1
"The skeleton of a giant Tyrannosaurus Rex, a creature that roamed the Earth 67 million years ago, sold for 5.5 million Swiss francs ($6.13 million), less than expected, in Zurich on Tuesday. Measuring 3.9 metres (12.8 feet) high and 11.6 metres (38.1 feet) long, TRX-293 TRINITY is a composite skeleton of 293 bones from three different T-Rexs found between 2008 and 2023 in the U.S. states of Montana and Wyoming. An undisclosed buyer offered the winning bid of 4.8 million Swiss francs, less than the 5 million to 8 million Swiss francs estimate, but the total price was higher with the buyer's premium and fees at Koller Auctions. It was the first time in Europe and the third time worldwide that an entire T-Rex skeleton of exceptional quality was offered at auction, Koller, Switzerland's largest auction house, said in a statement.",1
"The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed a case in which Republicans sought to keep in place a policy introduced under former President Donald Trump that had let American officials quickly expel hundreds of thousands of migrants at the U.S.-Mexican border. The policy, known as Title 42, was implemented by Trump's administration in March 2020 - early in the COVID-19 pandemic - as a measure tied to a public health emergency. President Joe Biden's administration allowed the policy to expire last week, with new asylum restrictions taking effect. At issue in the case, which the court had agreed to hear in December, was whether a group of Republican state attorneys general could intervene to defend the Title 42 policy after U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan in November ruled the public health order unlawful in a lawsuit by asylum-seeking migrant families.",1
"The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions on 17 people and entities based in China and Mexico who it accused of enabling production of counterfeit fentanyl-laced pills, as the Biden administration seeks to stem imports of the deadly drug. The Treasury Department said it slapped sanctions on seven entities and six people based in China, as well as one business and three people based in Mexico. It accused those targeted of being involved in the sale of pill press machines and other equipment used to impress counterfeit trade markings like Xanax and M30 onto illicitly produced pills, often laced with fentanyl and destined for the United States. Treasury's sanctions target every stage of the deadly supply chain fueling the surge in fentanyl poisonings and deaths across the country, Treasury's Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson said in a statement.",1
"Turkey called on NATO hopeful Sweden on Tuesday to prosecute those responsible for projecting the flag of an outlawed group onto the parliament building in Stockholm, on the day of Turkish elections that extended President Tayyip Erdogan's rule. A Swedish parliament spokesperson said a number of people projected messages onto the building in Sweden's capital late on Sunday, adding it had no documentation about what was projected. The warning could raise the stakes ahead of a mid-July NATO summit at which some alliance members are urging Turkey to back Sweden's membership bid, after a year of delays over concerns that Stockholm must do more to take on militant groups. Footage first shared on Twitter by the so-called Swedish Solidarity Committee for Rojava - a reference to Kurdish regions of Syria - projected a flag of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) on the parliament building.",1
"Turkey's lira hit fresh record lows against the dollar on Monday, though stocks rallied, after President Tayyip Erdogan secured victory in Sunday's presidential election, extending his increasingly authoritarian rule into a third decade. Erdogan prevailed despite years of economic turmoil that critics blame on his unorthodox economic policies, which the opposition had pledged to reverse. The lira weakened to 20.1050 to the dollar during its worst trading day in eight months, breaking through the previous record low touched on Friday. The lira has slumped more than 7% since the start of the year, and lost more than 90% of its value over the past decade, with the economy in the grip of boom-and-bust cycles and rampant bouts of inflation.",1
"Two of five people still missing after the partial collapse of an Iowa apartment building this weekend were likely inside at the time, officials said on Tuesday, but the structure is too unstable to immediately resume a search for them. Experts were evaluating the structural integrity of the part of the building that remained standing after suspending a search through the rubble out of concern for the safety of rescue workers, said James Morris, fire marshal for Davenport, a small city on the Mississippi River, just west of Illinois. The building is unstable and continues to worsen as time progresses, he said at a news conference. We are very sympathetic to the possibility that there are two people still left inside. Officials declined to comment on why only two of the five were believed to have been inside at the time of collapse, and did not disclose the possible whereabouts of the other three.",1
"U.S. holiday air passenger travel topped 2019 pre-COVID levels over the Memorial Day weekend, which typically marks the start of the busy U.S. summer air travel season, figures from the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) showed on Tuesday. The TSA said nearly 9.8 million passengers were screened or passed though security checks over the four-day weekend, about 300,000 more than over the same holiday period in 2019, the agency said on Tuesday. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), airlines and flight tracking websites reported smooth travel over the Memorial Day period and significant improvements over 2022 performance. The FAA said just 0.6% of holiday travel period flights through Monday were canceled versus 2.3% in 2022 and 1.4% in 2019.",1
"U.S. President Joe Biden said Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan in a call on Monday repeated Ankara's desire to buy F-16 fighter jets from the United States, while Biden told him Washington wanted Ankara to drop its objection to Sweden's joining NATO. The exchange took place when Biden called Erdogan to congratulate him on his victory in Turkey's presidential election on Sunday. I spoke to Erdogan. I congratulated Erdogan. He still wants to work on something on the F-16s. I told him we wanted a deal with Sweden, so let's get that done. And so we'll be back in touch with one another, Biden told reporters before departing the White House for Delaware. Asked if he expected any movement from Erdogan on Sweden's NATO membership, Biden said: I raised that issue with him. We're going to talk more about it next week. Sweden and Finland applied for NATO membership last year, ditching long-held policies of military non-alignment following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Bids for membership must be approved by all NATO members. Turkey and Hungary have yet to approve Sweden's bid.",1
"U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Wednesday that seeing a greater concentration among the largest banks would not be desirable and she believes it is important to maintain a diverse banking sector. A mix of large banks, regional banks and mid-sized community banks would be the healthiest option, Yellen said. Banks of different types serve different needs. And I think that's a great strength of our banking system. So in general, seeing greater concentration among the largest banks is not something that's desirable, Yellen said in a virtual appearance at the Wall Street Journal's CEO Council Summit in London. We want to make sure that there's healthy competition throughout the economy, including in the banking system. Bank watchdogs have been under intense scrutiny after recent bank collapses triggered a rout in global banking shares and set off fears of contagion.",1
"Ukrainian drones struck wealthy districts of Moscow on Tuesday, Russia said in what one politician called the most dangerous attack on the capital since World War Two, while Kyiv was also hit from the air for the third time in 24 hours. Since Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into its neighbour in February 2022, the war has largely been fought inside Ukraine. Aerial strikes on targets far from the front have intensified amid a ragged stalemate on the ground with Russian forces entrenched along an extended line in Ukraine's east and south. One of the strategic southern places Russian forces have controlled since nearly the beginning of the invasion is the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, and on Tuesday the United Nations nuclear watchdog chief asked Ukraine and Russia to respect five principles to safeguard the station. Neither Ukraine nor Russia have committed to respect the principles. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Grossi has been trying for months to secure an agreement to reduce the risk of a catastrophic nuclear accident from military activity like shelling at Zaporizhzhia, Europe's biggest nuclear power plant.",1
"Under the new rules, government expenditures will not be allowed to rise by more than 70% of any increase in revenue, with spending growth also limited to between 0.6% and 2.5% per year above inflation. If the goals are not met, expenditure growth will be restricted to 50% of revenue rises as a penalty. The Senate is set to vote on the legislation. The thing is a lot tighter than it looks, he said at an event organized by Brazilian newspapers Valor Economico and O Globo, adding that leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's government would need to have discussions with the public and Congress about spending cuts in priority areas such as education and health.",1
"Van Houten, 73, the youngest of Manson's devotees, has been recommended for early release by the state parole board on five occasions since 2016, but was denied three times by Newsom and twice by his predecessor, fellow Democrat Jerry Brown. The 2-to-1 decision from a three-member panel of the state's 2nd District Court of Appeal sided with the Board of Parole Hearings' findings that Van Houten, who was 19 when the murders were committed, has been rehabilitated and no longer poses a danger to society. The governor could appeal the decision to the California Supreme Court. In his most recent rejection of her parole in 2022, Newsom cited supposed inconsistencies between Van Houten's statements then and at the time of the murders, which he said suggested gaps in Ms. Van Houten's insight or candor, or both.",1
"Vice Media received court permission on Tuesday to borrow $5 million to fund its bankruptcy, saying it will use the money in part to pay freelancers and prepare the company for a sale. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Mastando at a hearing in Manhattan said he would allow Vice to borrow additional money from its existing senior lenders, a group that includes Fortress Investment Group, Soros Fund Management and Monroe Capital (MRCC.O). Mastando said he would approve the first $5 million of the loan within a day, and that he would consider Vice's request to borrow an additional $5 million in June. Vice attorney Kyle Ortiz said that approval of the bankruptcy loan would also unlock $20 million in a frozen bank account, as part of the lenders' agreement to fund Vice's bankruptcy. Vice will have more than enough cash to pay $2 million owed to freelancers and other pressing operational costs, Ortiz said.",1
"Virgin Orbit Holdings Inc on Wednesday blamed a dislodged filter for a failed rocket launch in January, and said it was planning another mission later this year as the issue had been fixed. The satellite launch company, founded by billionaire Richard Branson, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this month as it struggled to secure long-term funding following the failed launch. The January mission using Virgin Orbit's centerpiece LauncherOne rocket, the first rocket launch out of Britain, failed to reach orbit and sent its payload of commercial and defense-related research satellites plunging into the ocean. Ground test results matched flight data, confirming the dislodging of the filter as the initiation event of the January launch failure, Virgin Orbit said on Wednesday.",1
"Wailing air raid sirens and cell phone alerts calling for rare evacuations rattled residents of the South Korean capital, Seoul, early on Wednesday after North Korea launched what it said was a satellite. North Korea launched the rocket toward the south, South Korea's military said, prompting emergency alerts and evacuation warnings in parts of South Korea and Japan. I was so panicked. 911 lines were busy and the internet was slow, said Lee Juyeon, 33, a resident in the densely populated city of 9 million who has a nine month old child. So without knowing what was really happening, I was about to head down to a basement wearing a wrap carrier with my baby. The sirens started in Seoul at 6:32 a.m. (2132 GMT Tuesday) as the city issued a Presidential Alert asking citizens to prepare for potential evacuation.",1
"Warren Buffett on Saturday said Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) is cautious around the banking sector, largely because of poor messaging by officials around government-insured deposits, as well as distorted incentives he said were brought on by banking regulation. A crisis of confidence in the U.S. banking sector has led to the failure of three midsized banks since March as depositors fled from smaller banks, with calls for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) to raise its $250,000 limit guarantee on deposits. The messaging by politicians, government agencies and the media around the safety of the banking system has been poor, the nonagenarian billionaire said at Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. The U.S. government and the American public have no interest in having a bank fail and having deposits actually lost by people, he said.",1
"Energizer Holdings Inc (ENR.N) and Walmart Inc (WMT.N) have been sued by consumers and retailers in three proposed class actions accusing them of conspiring to raise the prices of disposable batteries. According to complaints filed on Friday, Energizer agreed under pressure from Walmart to inflate wholesale battery prices for other retailers starting around January 2018, and require those retailers not to undercut Walmart on price. Walmart rivals allegedly risked higher wholesale prices or being cut off by Energizer, the largest U.S. disposable battery maker, if they charged less at checkout than Walmart, the world's largest retailer. The scheme resulted in higher prices from Energizer and Berkshire Hathaway-owned (BRKa.N) Duracell, which together control 85% of the disposable battery market, that inflation and changes in demand could not explain, the complaints said.",1
